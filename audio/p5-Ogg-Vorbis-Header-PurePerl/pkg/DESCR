An object-oriented interface to Ogg Vorbis information and comment
fields, implemented entirely in Perl. Intended to be a drop in
replacement for Ogg::Vobis::Header.

Unlike Ogg::Vorbis::Header, this module will go ahead and fill in all of
the information fields as soon as you construct the object. In other
words, the new and load constructors have identical behavior.
