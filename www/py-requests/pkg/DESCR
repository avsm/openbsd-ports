Requests is an ISC Licensed HTTP library, written in Python, for human
beings.

Requests allow you to send HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE HTTP
requests. You can add headers, form data, multipart files, and
parameters with simple Python dictionaries, and access the response data
in the same way. It's powered by urllib2, but it does all the hard work
and crazy hacks for you.
