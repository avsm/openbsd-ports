TagPy is a set of Python bindings for Scott Wheeler's TagLib. It builds
upon Boost.Python, a wrapper generation library which is part of the
renowned Boost set of C++ libraries.

Just like TagLib, TagPy can read and write ID3 tags in MP3, FLAC and
MPC, access Xiph Comments in Ogg Vorbis Files and Ogg Flac Files and
access APE tags in Musepack and MP3 files.
