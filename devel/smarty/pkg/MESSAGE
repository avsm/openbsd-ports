You might want to append Smarty directory to `include_path' found in
PHP configuration file ${PREFIX}/conf/php.ini. It may look like this:

include_path = ".:/pear/lib:/var/www/pear/lib:/smarty:/var/www/smarty"

Note: First entry (`/smarty') is necessary because on OpenBSD Apache runs
      in chroot by default.
