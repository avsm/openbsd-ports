The GNOME-DB project aims to provide a free unified data access
architecture to the GNOME project. GNOME-DB is useful for any
application that accesses persistent data (not only databases, but
data), since it now contains a pretty good data management API.

Mergeant is a front-end for database administrators and database
application developers.

It can use all the data providers that are configured for libgda
(mysql, postgredql, sqlite, bdb, openldap, etc).
