rpm uses a few mktemp, but looking at these, they all appear to be wrapped
and calling open() properly.

Note that rpm has some inherent security problems anyway. Who should you
trust when installing RPMs on your system ? Its use should probably be 
limited to installing linux-compatibility library, within ports, with
proper md5 checksumming.
