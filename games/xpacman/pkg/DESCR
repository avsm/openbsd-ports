You  are Pacman, and you are supposed to eat all the small
dots to get to the next level. You are  also  supposed  to
keep  away from the ghosts, if they take you, you lose one
life, unless you have eaten a large dot, then you can, for
a  limited amount of time, chase and eat the ghosts. There
is also bonus available, for a limited amount of time.  An
X  gives  just  points, but a little pacman gives an extra
life.
