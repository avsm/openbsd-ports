Catfish is a handy file searching tool for linux and unix. Basically it
is a frontend for different search engines (daemons) which provides a
unified interface. The interface is intentionally lightweight and
simple, using only GTK+2. You can configure it to your needs by using
several command line options.

Supported backends are find, (s)locate, doodle, tracker, beagle, strigi
and pinot.
