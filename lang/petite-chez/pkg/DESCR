Petite Chez Scheme is a complete Scheme system that is fully compatible
with Chez Scheme but uses high-speed threaded interpreter technology in
place of Chez Scheme's incremental native-code compiler. Petite Chez
Scheme may be used without license, fee or royalty for any purpose,
including for resale as part of a commercial product.
