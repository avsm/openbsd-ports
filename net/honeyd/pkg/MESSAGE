Configuring honeyd for use on OpenBSD
-------------------------------------

The location to the honeyd configuration file must be specified via the
-f switch.  Also, honeyd requires an arp daemon to (falsely) answer arp
queries.  rarpd(8) in base or arpd from ports can both be used for this.
See honeyd(8) for more detailed information on setting up honeyd.
