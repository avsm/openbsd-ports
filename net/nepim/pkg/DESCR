nepim stands for network pipemeter, a tool for measuring available
bandwidth between hosts. nepim is also useful to generate network
traffic for testing purposes. nepim operates in client/server mode, is
able to handle multiple parallel traffic streams, reports periodic
partial statistics along the testing, and supports IPv6.
