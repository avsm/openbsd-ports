The name GiNaC is an iterated and recursive abbreviation for GiNaC is
Not a CAS, where CAS stands for Computer Algebra System. It has been
developed to become a replacement engine for xloops which in the past
was powered by the Maple CAS. Its design is revolutionary in a sense
that contrary to other CAS it does not try to provide extensive
algebraic capabilities and a simple programming language but instead
accepts a given language (C++) and extends it by a set of algebraic
capabilities.
