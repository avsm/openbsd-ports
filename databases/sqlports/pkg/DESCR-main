SQLite database of every port in the system. This can be queried through
e.g., sqlitebrowser, or any kind of programming interface.

This is more suitable for human consumption, use sqlite-compact for
more structured information.

Database Schema:
- Ports(FULLPKGPATH, ...)
holds all the information retrieved through various variables, e.g.,:
    AUTOCONF_VERSION 
    AUTOMAKE_VERSION 
    BROKEN 
    *DEPENDS 
    CATEGORIES
    COMMENT 
    CONFIGURE_STYLE 
    DESCR 
    DISTFILES 
    DISTNAME 
    DIST_SUBDIR 
    EPOCH
    FLAVORS 
    HOMEPAGE 
    IS_INTERACTIVE 
    MAINTAINER
    MASTER_SITES*
    MODULES 
    MULTI_PACKAGES 
    NO_*
    NOT_FOR_ARCHS
    ONLY_FOR_ARCHS 
    PERMIT_*
    PKGNAME 
    PKGSPEC
    PKG_ARCH 
    PSEUDO_FLAVOR
    PSEUDO_FLAVORS 
    REGRESS_IS_INTERACTIVE 
    REVISION
    SEPARATE_BUILD 
    SHARED_LIBS 
    SHARED_ONLY 
    SUBPACKAGE 
    SUPDISTFILES 
    TARGETS
    USE_*
    WANTLIB 
This information is mostly unchanged, except for replacing Yes/No variables
with 1/0. Variables not present in a given port are left undefined.

Note that USE_LIBTOOL is 3-valued: 2 is gnu, 1 is yes, undef is no.

The FULLPKGPATH is complete, including flavors markers (but not pseudo 
flavors, tack on PSEUDO_FLAVOR for that). For every port with MULTI_PACKAGES 
settings, one entry is written for each SUBPACKAGE.

- Paths (FULLPKGPATH, PKGPATH)
PKGPATH is the stripped down version or FULLPKGPATH, without flavors 
or subpackage markers.

- Flavors(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
- Categories(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
- Multi(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
- Modules(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
- Configure(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
- ConfigureArgs(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
- NotForArch(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
- OnlyForArch(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
- Targets(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
All of these variable values are actually lists. These lists are taken apart
and result in many entries in these secondary tables (or none if the list
is completely empty)

- Depends(FULLPKGPATH, FULLDEPENDS, DEPENDSPATH, TYPE)
All depends are stored in a single table, including the type:
R -> run
L -> lib
B -> build
Regress -> regress
with FULLDEPENDS the full text of the dependency, and DEPENDSPATH the PKGPATH
we depend upon.
- Wantlib(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
All the libraries the FULLPKGPATH depends upon, with and without version number,
coming from either the WANTLIB variable or various LIB_DEPENDS.

- BROKEN(FULLPKGPATH, ARCH, VALUE)
All the broken entries, which might be arch-dependent.

- Shared_Libs(FULLPKGPATH, LIBNAME, VERSION)
