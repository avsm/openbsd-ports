sftp and rsftp are ftp replacements that run over an ssh or rsh
tunnel.  These programs allows files to be transferred to and from
remote servers.  Authentication is provided by the underlying ssh/rsh
connection.

When sftp or rsftp is run, the server (sftpserv) is automatically
run on the remote end.
