The yEnc module provide a simple API for doing raw encoding/decoding of
yencoded binaries, mainly for retrieving or posting to the usenet.  This
implementation is really simple and intended mainly as an exercise to
the author but is also significantly faster than any possible pure
Python implementation and it's being actually used by some Python nntp
clients out there.
