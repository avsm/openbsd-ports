The panorama tools are mainly used to build panoramic images from
a set of overlapping images. The usability extends beyond "just"
building panoramas by far though. You can, for instance, use them
to render an average of multiple images to broaden the dynamic range
of the images or average out noise. You can also build object movies
with them, morph between images and much more.
