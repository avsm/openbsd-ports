This is an implementation of a SAX2 driver sitting on top of 
Expat (XML::Parser).

It is still incomplete, though most of the basic SAX2 events should be
available.

XML::Parser has no listed callbacks for the following events, which are
therefore not presently generated (ways may be found in the future):

  * ignorable_whitespace
  * skipped_entity
  * start_entity / end_entity
  * resolve_entity

Note that this package currently does not register itself with XML::SAX,
so you have to add the parser manually before you can use it.
