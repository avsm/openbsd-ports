The bluetooth-libs package consists of a few Bluetooth network libraries
derived from NetBSD, and originally from FreeBSD.

libbluetooth provides a set of common routines to be used in the
Bluetooth network applications similar to the libc network routines like
gethostbyname(3).

libsdp provides a set of routines that deal with the Bluetooth Service
Discovery Protocol.
