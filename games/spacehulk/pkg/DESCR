Space Hulk is a great board game of Games Workshop in the world of
Warhammer 40000.
This is a two player turn-based game where one play the 'Marine', the
other play the alien called 'Genestealer'. This video game is a complete
conversion of the board game with the 2nd edition rules. The project is
aiming at providing a way to play SpaceHulk on your computer exactly as
you could do it with the real board version but with some extra : you
can play via network (no need to have two players in the same room)
synchronized or asynchronized (via e-mail), and you will even be able to
play solo against an artificial intelligent opponent. Currently, only
HotSeat and Play-By-Email mode game are implemented.
