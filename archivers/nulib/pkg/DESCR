Nulib is a shell-based NuFX archive utility, based loosely on ARC for
the IBM PC and ar(1) under UNIX.  It allows you to perform certain
operations on the same archives used by ShrinkIt, including view
archive contents, add to archive, extract from archive, and delete
from archive.  In addition, it will list and unpack files from
Binary II archives.
