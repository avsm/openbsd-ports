Swish-e is a fast, flexible, and free open source system for indexing
collections of Web pages or other files. Swish-e is ideally suited for
collections of a million documents or smaller. Using the GNOME libxml2
parser and a collection of filters, Swish-e can index plain text,
e-mail, PDF, HTML, XML, Microsoft Word/PowerPoint/Excel and just about
any file that can be converted to XML or HTML text. Swish-e is also
often used to supplement databases like the MySQL DBMS for very fast
full-text searching.
