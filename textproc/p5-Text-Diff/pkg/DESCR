Text::Diff provides a basic set of services akin to the GNU "diff"
utility. It is not anywhere near as feature complete as GNU "diff", but
it is better integrated with Perl and available on all platforms. It is
often faster than shelling out to a system's "diff" executable for small
files, and generally slower on larger files.
