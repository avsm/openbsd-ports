*************************************************
A default administrator user has been created. The user name is 'admin',
password 'opennap'. You will probably want to change these. To do so,
edit the file ${PREFIX}/share/opennap/users.

Example configuration files are located in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/opennap.
Copy them to ${PREFIX}/share/opennap, removing the 'sample.' prefix
(e.g., 'sample.conf' becomes 'conf') and edit to your preferences.
Documentation is installed under ${PREFIX}/share/doc/opennap. If you
would like to link your server to the global Napigator search system,
go to http://www.napigator.com and follow the directions under
"CAN I RUN MY OWN NAP SERVER?"
