This is Tcl8.4, an embeddable tool command language. It is an easy-to-use
scripting language with clear syntax. Because it is a scripting
language, programs written in it are easily portable to other operating 
systems. Feature include networking functionality, string and number
manipulation, and regular expression support.

A rich set of extensions to the language are available, as well.

The best way to get started with Tcl is to read ``Tcl and the Tk
Toolkit, 4th ed'' by John K. Ousterhout, Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-13-038560-3.

A full set of manual pages is also provided with this package.
