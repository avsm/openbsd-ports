			    MOZILLA for OpenBSD

In good OpenBSD style I stole the NetBSD mozilla port and turned
it into an OpenBSD mozilla port.  The OpenBSD patches are 42395
bytes long and include the 11448 of NetBSD patches.  However:

	      ***** MOZILLA IS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME *****

I'm adding it to the OpenBSD ports for those that want to play and/or
get it to a state where it is ready for prime time.  Here are the
general caveats:

1) Only checked with lesstif 0.86.0, older versions will probably not
   work. Use the OpenBSD lesstif port -- it fixes a problem where the
   2.0 version of libXm.a overwrites the 1.2 version.

2) This warning is spit out on occasion

	    Warning: 
		Name: bookmarkList
		Class: XmLGrid
		Attempt to destroy dropSite info for widget that
	    hasn't been added as a dropSite.

   doesn't seem to hurt anything, though.

3) There are uses of tempnam, tmpnam, and mktemp that have not
   been looked at/changed yet.

4) It will NOT compile on a sparc with default optimizer settings.
   gcc blows up.  To compile on a sparc do this:

   make patch
   change line 257 of work/mozilla/config/config.mk from -O to -O0
   make

   HOWEVER: that only makes it compile.  Try to run and you'll get
   `Memory fault' in 5-10 seconds.  Perfect opportunity for sparc
   developers to get their debuging skills in shape :-)

5) I've used it less than 10 minutes on an i386.  It didn't crash
   in that time :-)

6) I've not tried to build it/run it on any other architecture.
   I suspect the usual problems wrt libraries on the alpha.
