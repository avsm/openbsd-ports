Gyrus is a small tool for the administration of mailboxes in IMAP/Cyrus
servers.  The main idea behind it, is to provide mail server
administrators with a better way to do the daily maintenance than a
command line or a plain and boring telnet client.

The main features gyrus includes are:
	* Browsing, creation and deletion of mailboxes.
	* Mailbox quotas control.
	* Management of IMAP Access Control Lists.
	* Creation of printable reports with over-quota mailboxes.
