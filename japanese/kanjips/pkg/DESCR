Japanese documents are hard to print when you don't have 
a Japanese PostScript printer, especially the huge fonts
and the required extension.

Kanjips is a poor man's replacement, that can convert
Japanese strings in a PostScript documents to bitmap equivalent.

The quality of the result is not very good, but at least it's readable.
