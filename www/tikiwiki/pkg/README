| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tikiwiki has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
 # ln -s ../tikiwiki /var/www/htdocs/tikiwiki
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

*** First install
To complete the installation point your web browser to:
http://<hostname>/tikiwiki/tiki-install.php

*** Upgrade
To complete the upgrade, you must update your database schema using the
scripts under ${INSTDIR}/tikiwiki/db/.
Make sure to read the official documentation at:
http://tikiwiki.org/ReleaseNotes20#1_9_x_to_2_0_migration_tips

The default superuser account is: admin (password: admin).

* Creating a dedicated user and database for Tikiwiki:
  While Tikiwiki partially supports any relational databases such as
  PostgreSQL or SQLite, only MySQL is fully supported.
  Also, it is recommended to use the mysqli extension (php-mysqli) for php
  communication to the database.

  $ mysqladmin -u root -p create 'tiki'
  $ mysql -u root -p mysql
  mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER
      -> ON tiki TO 'tiki'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
  mysql> quit

* Configuring your /var/www/conf/php.ini for Tikiwiki:
  - if you experience timeouts you may need to increase
    max_execution_time and max_input_time
  - if you want to allow trackback pings in your blogs you need to set
    allow_url_fopen = On
  - you should also set the default character encoding to utf-8
    default_charset = "utf-8"

* In order to use the Maps feature, please install the Mapserver PHP extension
  (php-mapscript).

* Tikiwiki is a big piece of software, you should refer to the official
  documentation before using it. (http://doc.tikiwiki.org/)
