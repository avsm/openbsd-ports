LADVD uses CDP / LLDP frames to inform switches about connected hosts,
which simplifies ethernet switch management. It does this by creating
a raw socket at startup, and then switching to a non-privileged user
for the remaining runtime. Every 30 seconds it will transmit CDP/LLDP
packets reflecting the current system state. Interfaces (bridge,
trunk, wireless), capabilities (bridging, forwarding, wireless) and
addresses (IPv4, IPv6) are detected dynamically.
