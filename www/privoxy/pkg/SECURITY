sprintf() and strcpy() changed to snprintf() and strlcpy()
respectively in:
actions.c, cgi.c, cgisimple.c, errlog.c, filters.c, 
gateway.c, jcc.c, loadcfg.c, miscutil.c, urlmatch.c

The privoxy daemon should be run as a non-root user.  The
install sets up a privoxy user and group, installs config
and log files with that user and group, and points the 
user at the way to start the daemon with the user and 
group.
