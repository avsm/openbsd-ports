The MediaWiki has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web server:
   # ln -s ../mediawiki /var/www/htdocs/mediawiki
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

You can ensure you have a working install by accessing:
http://<localhost>/mediawiki/
