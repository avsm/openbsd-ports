The goal of Couch Potato is to create a minimal framework in order
to store and retrieve Ruby objects to/from CouchDB and create
and query views.

It follows the document/view/querying semantics established by
CouchDB and won't try to mimic ActiveRecord behavior in any way
as that IS BAD.

Lastly Couch Potato aims to provide a seamless integration
with Ruby on Rails, e.g. routing, form helpers etc.
