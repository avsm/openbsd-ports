<h3>Theoretical part:</h3>

<p>Before you start to use bmf it is a good thing to know  a  little bit about
   the theoretical background of
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html">Bayesian spamfiltering</a>.


<h3>Basic installation:</h3>

<p>After installing the port put this at the top of your
   <tt class="FILENAME">.procmailrc</tt>.

<dl><dd><pre>
:0fw
* &lt; 256000
| bmf -p

:0e
{
EXITCODE=$?
}

:0:
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
zspam # This is the mailbox where all spam goes.</pre></dd></dl>

<p>Now you have to tell bmf the difference between spam and non-spam messages.

As an example you can add these shortcuts to your <tt class="FILENAME">.muttrc</tt>

<dl><dd><pre>
macro index &lt;f3&gt; "|bmf -S\n&lt;save-message&gt;=zspam\n" "SPAM"
macro index &lt;f4&gt; "|bmf -N\n&lt;save-message&gt;=Maildir\n" "NO SPAM"
macro pager &lt;f3&gt; "|bmf -S\n&lt;save-message&gt;=zspam\n" "SPAM"
macro pager &lt;f4&gt; "|bmf -N\n&lt;save-message&gt;=Maildir\n" "NO SPAM"
</pre></dd></dl>

<p>Now you can press the F3-button to tell bmf a message in  your  inbox
   is spam ( <tt class="FILENAME">bmf -S</tt>  ) and  move  it  to  your
   spam-folder.


<h3>Feeding a spam-archive to bmf:</h3>
<p>To speed up the process of feeding  the  bmf-database  you  can  also
   download a recent
   <a href="http://www.em.ca/~bruceg/spam/">spam archive</a>
   and run the files in the archive through the following oneliner:

<dl><dd><pre>for i in * ; do bmf -s -i $i; done</pre></dd></dl>

<p>This method is not recommended by the author since the headers  of  a
   message are also taken in account and the  headers  of  the  messages
   from a spam-archive do not match yours, but I had good  results  with
   this method.

<h3>Mixing with spamassassin:</h3>

<p>You can also mix bmf with
   <a  href="http://spamassassin.org">spamassassin</a>.
   bmf is much lighter than spamassassin but spamassassin does not have
   to be trained. You can actually use spamassassin to train bmf. Change
   your <tt class="FILENAME">.procmailrc</tt> to something like this:

<dl><dd><pre>
:0fw
* &lt; 256000
| bmf -p

:0e
{
EXITCODE=$?
}

:0:
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
zspam-bmf


:0fw
* &lt; 256000
| spamc -p 4321 -f

:0e
{
EXITCODE=$?
}

:0:
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
{
  :0c
  | bmf -S
  :0
  zspam-sa
}
</pre></dd></dl>

<p>All mail cought by bmf will be send to the zspam-bmf folder. All spam
   missed by bmf but cought by spamassassin will be fed to bmf for
   training and send to the zspam-sa folder.
