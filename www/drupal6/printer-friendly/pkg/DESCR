This module allows you to generate printer friendly versions of any
node by navigating to www.example.com/print/nid, where nid is the
node id of content to render. 

A link is inserted in the each node (configurable in the content
type settings), that opens a version of the page with no sidebars,
search boxes, navigation pages, etc.
