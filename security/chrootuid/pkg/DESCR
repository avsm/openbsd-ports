Chrootuid makes it easy to run network services at a low privilege
level and with restricted file system access. This utility employs
both chroot and su to confine users to specified areas by assigning
appropriate userids.

Chrootuid was written by Wietse Venema; this port includes Phil
Pennock's initgroups patch.
