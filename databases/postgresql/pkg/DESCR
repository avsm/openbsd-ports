PostgreSQL is Object-Relational Database Management System.
It supports almost all SQL constructs, including transactions,
subselects, and user-defined types and functions.
It is not ANSI SQL compliant, but it gets closer with every release.

OpenBSD PostgreSQL port build produces several packages:

 postgresql: complete package
   contains all files needed for creating, administering and maintaining
   databases, quering and manipulating data in them, libraries and header
   files for database applications development and man pages

 postgresql-clients: client-side applications and headers
   reduced variant of complete package without backend-related files

 postgresql-docs: documentation
   additinal documentation: FAQs, READMEs; PostgreSQL manuals in HTML format:
   Administrator's Guide, Programmer's Manual, PostgreSQL Tutorial and
   User's Guide and Integrated Documentation package contains all the above
   documantation


Packages can be built with additional FLAVORs:

 tcl:  PostgreSQL built with TCL/TK interfaces.
       Provides TCL/TK language interfaces to Postgres backends; includes
       pgaccess - Postgres graphical interactive client.
       This FLAVOR requires lang/tcl/8.3 and x11/tk/8.3 packages.
       
 odbc: PostgreSQL built with ODBC (Open Data Base Connectivity) driver package
       You need to install some driver manager to use it. You can use iODBC
       (intrinsic Open Database Connectivity) driver manager can be found in
       databases/iodbc directory in your OpenBSD ports tree.
