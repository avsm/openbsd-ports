This project aims at increasing the number of available Arabic free and open
source fonts. The goals of this project are:

  * Create and/or salvage free and open TTF Arabic fonts.
  * Create a central repository of all free and open source Arabic fonts
    (TTF and otherwise) in order to get them included into the various
    distributions.
  * To better couple and artistically match Arabic fonts to their latin
    counterparts.
