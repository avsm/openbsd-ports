Once you have the config files under ${SYSCONFDIR}/nut set up properly, the
following block can be added to your /etc/rc.local file to start nut.

# Start Nut
if [ -x ${PREFIX}/bin/upsdrvctl ]; then
    echo -n ' nut'
    ${PREFIX}/bin/upsdrvctl start > /dev/null 2>&1
    ${PREFIX}/sbin/upsd > /dev/null 2>&1
    ${PREFIX}/sbin/upsmon > /dev/null 2>&1
fi

For USB-connected devices, the userid running NUT (normally _nut unless
set otherwise with the -u option) must have write access to the relevant
devices: /dev/usbX to detect the UPS, and /dev/ugenX.XX to control it.
