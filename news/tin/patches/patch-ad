  A slightly better method is to set \fItin\fP setuid news and have all index 
  files created and updated in the news spool directory 
! (i.e., \fI/var/spool/news/.news\fP). This has the advantage that there will 
  only be one copy of the index files on each machine on your network, but the 
  disadvantage is that you will have \fItin\fP running setuid news.

  A better method is to install the \fItind\fP index file updating daemon and 
  have it create and update index files for all groups in your active file at
  regular intervals in the news spool directory 
! (i.e., \fI/var/spool/news/.news\fP). This has the advantage that there will 
  only be one copy of the index files on each machine on your network and 
  \fItin\fP must not be setuid news, but the disadvantage is that you will have 
  to have news permissions to install \fItind\fP and root permissions to install

  When a user starts \fItin\fP it is possible to inform them of any important
  changes/information concerning the news system by displaying a message of the
  day (motd) file. The motd file should be created in your news lib directory
! (i.e., \fI/usr/lib/news/motd\fP) and should have file permissions set to 0644.
  The motd file will only be displayed if its contents is newer than the last
  time the user started \fItin\fP. If reading news via NNTP my XMOTD patch will
  have to have been applied to your NNTP server.
