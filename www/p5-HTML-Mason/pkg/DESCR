Mason is a powerful Perl-based web site development and delivery
engine. With Mason you can embed Perl code in your HTML and construct
pages from shared, reusable components.

Mason solves the common problems of site development: caching,
debugging, templating, simulating browser conditions, maintaining
development and production sites, and more.

Although it can be used from CGI or even stand-alone, it is optimally
designed for use with two other open source technologies: mod_perl
and Apache.
