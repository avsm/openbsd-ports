Bash is the GNU Project's Bourne Again SHell, an interactive shell
with Bourne shell syntax (/bin/sh);  but also with interactive command
line editing, job control on architectures that support it, Csh-like
history features and brace expansion, and a slew of other stuff.

For more information on the features of Bash that are new to this type
of shell, see the file `documentation/features.texi'.  There is also a
processed DVI file there, as well as a large man page.
