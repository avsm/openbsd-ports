This product provides a mini-framework for expressing the configured
state of a Zope Site as a set of filesystem artifacts. These artifacts
consist of declarative XML files, which spell out the configuration
settings for each "tool" in the site , and supporting scripts /
templates, in their "canonical" filesystem representations.
