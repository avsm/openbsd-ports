The Link checker module extracts links from your content when saved and
periodically tries to detect broken hypertext links by checking the
remote sites and evaluating the HTTP response codes. It shows all broken
links in the reports/logs section and on the content edit page if a link
check has been failed. An author specific broken links report is also
available in "My Account".
