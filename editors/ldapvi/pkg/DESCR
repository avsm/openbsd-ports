Using ldapvi you can update LDAP entries with a text editor.
There are other implementations of the same idea, but ldapvi:

- is written in C
- is reasonably fast and small
- shows a summary of changes before committing them; details of the
  changes can be previewed in LDIF format
- uses an LDIF-like format in the editor
- can rename entries
- does not give up easily; on error, you can edit the file again or
  rebind to the server and try again
