| XEmacs is pretty useless as-is.  It is just an engine.
| You need to install (XE)packages to provide your users full functionality.
| There is two methods to achieve this :
| 1 - install the xemacs21-sumo (O)package.  It contains all the 
|     (XE)packages currently supported by the XEmacs team.
|     It's fast, easy and your users won't ever bother you again about this.
|     On the other hand the (O)package is quite huge.
| 2 - you have to install by hand every XEmacs' (XE)packages as described
|     in the XEmacs documentation. (Search for "packages" in the info tree.)
|     There are a lot of interdependencies between XEmacs' (XE)packages
|     and you may end up with everything installed just as method 1 would
|     have (without the hassle).
|
| Note: XEmacs (XE)packages are orthogonal to OpenBSD (O)packages.
|       (Yes, it's confusing.  XE are XEmacs' and (O) are OpenBSD ones)
