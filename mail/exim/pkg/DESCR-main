Exim is a mail transfer agent (MTA) for hosts that are running Unix or Unix-
like operating systems. It was designed on the assumption that it would be run
on hosts that are permanently connected to the Internet. However, it can
be used on intermittently connected hosts with suitable configuration
adjustments.

This port can be built with any or all of the following flavors:

* mysql		- support mysql queries for lookups
* postgresql	- support postgresql queries for lookups
* sqlite3	- support for sqlite queries for lookups
* ldap		- support ldap (OpenLDAP) queries for lookups
* sasl		- support for SASL

It is possible to use the deprecated "demime" condition in the DATA ACL. If
possible, use the MIME ACL instead of the "demime" condition.
