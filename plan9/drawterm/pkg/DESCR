Drawterm is a program that users of non-Plan 9 systems can use to
establish graphical cpu connections with Plan 9 cpu servers.  Just as
a real Plan 9 terminal does, drawterm serves its local name space as
well as some devices (the keyboard, mouse, and screen) to a remote cpu
server, which mounts this name space on /mnt/term and starts a shell.
Typically, either explicitly or via the profile, one uses the shell to
start rio.
