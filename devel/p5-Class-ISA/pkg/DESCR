Suppose you have a class (like Food::Fish::Fishstick) that is derived,
via its @ISA, from one or more superclasses (as Food::Fish::Fishstick is
from Food::Fish, Life::Fungus, and Chemicals), and some of those
superclasses may themselves each be derived, via its @ISA, from one or
more superclasses (as above).

Class::ISA provides functions that return the ordered list of names 
of classes Perl would search to find a method, with no duplicates.
