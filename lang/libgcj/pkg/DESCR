``libgcj'' is the runtime that goes along with the gcj front end to
egcs. libgcj includes parts of the Java Class Libraries, plus glue to
connect the libraries to the compiler and the underlying OS.

libgcj eventually builds a couple of libraries (one for the runtime
and one for the garbage collector), a ``zip'' version of the class
libraries, and a program called ``jv-convert'' which can be used to do
character encoding transformations.

The runtime is not yet fully complete. Parts of the standard class
libraries are missing, and some libraries (such as AWT) have not even
been started. Also, there is not a bytecode interpreter; the runtime
currently assumes your application will be entirely compiled.
