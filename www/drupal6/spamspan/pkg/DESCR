The SpamSpan module obfuscates email addresses to help prevent spambots
from collecting them. The problem with most email address obfuscators is
that they rely upon JavaScript being enabled on the client side. This
makes the technique inaccessible to people with screen readers. SpamSpan
however will produce clickable links if JavaScript is enabled, and will
show the email address as example [at] example [dot] com if the browser
does not support JavaScript or if JavaScript is disabled.
