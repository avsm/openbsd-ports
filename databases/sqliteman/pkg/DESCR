sqlitemanager is a simple graphical interface to manage simple aspects
of sqlite database: queries, table views, simple modifications, 
indexes and trigger creation.

Compared to sqlitebrowser, it's a bit more heavy-handed. Features, among
other things, colored syntax for sql statements, and the ability to keep
several sql statements available at once.
