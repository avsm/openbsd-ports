xoris is a simple util that dumps a rgb-color value of any part of the
screen to stdout.  The program can do this in three variants:

1. hex (#b0958e)
2. string of rgb numbers (229 229 229)
3. abstract name (gray90)

To get such enumerated color specifications, click: Button1,
Ctrl+Button1, Shift+Button1 correspondingly.
