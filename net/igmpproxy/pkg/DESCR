igmpproxy is a simple multicast routing daemon which uses IGMP
forwarding to dynamically route multicast traffic.  Routing is done
by defining an "upstream" interface on which the daemon acts as a
normal Multicast client, and one or more "downstream" interfaces
that serves clients on the destination networks. This is useful in
situations where other dynamic multicast routers cannot be used.
