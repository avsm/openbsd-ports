kpoppassd is a kerberos password changing daemon that behaves like
poppassd. It allows a user to change his/her password remotely without
having to login. This is particularly useful for webmail systems that
use imap (i.e. horde/imp). The daemon works exactly like the original
poppassd. The only difference being that this poppassd changes a user's
Kerberos 5 password.
