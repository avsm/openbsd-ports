regionset allows you to check and set the region code of DVD drives.
This program was part of the package "dvd_disc_20000215.tar.gz" from
Convergence, which is no longer distributed because of the new German
copyright law. (The package also contained some CSS and copying related
tools.) regionset was separated and all CSS related stuff was removed.
This program is needed by everyone with a new DVD drive that doesn't
have a region code set, since the drive will only play Video DVDs when
the region code has been set once.

regionset must have write privileges to the device in question in order
to work.
