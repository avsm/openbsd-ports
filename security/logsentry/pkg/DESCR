Logsentry is a scheduled auditing tool that scans system log files
for security violations and unusual activity. Reports of suspicious
log entries are mailed to a specified user (usually root).

Logsentry was formerly known as logcheck. Even though the package
is now called logsentry-1.1.1, the actual files kept their names.
