-# Since 1970, EST-only Indiana has been like America/Indianapolis,
-# with exceptions noted below for Crawford, Starke, and Switzerland counties.
-# The parts of Indiana not listed below have been like America/Chicago,
-# America/Louisville, or America/New_York.
+# - Gibson, Jasper, Lake, LaPorte, Newton, Porter, Posey, Spencer,
+#   Vandenburgh, and Warrick counties have been like America/Chicago.
 #
+# - Dearborn and Ohio counties have been like America/New_York.
+#
+# - Clark, Floyd, and Harrison counties have been like

+#
+# - Daviess, Dubois, Knox, Martin, Perry, and Pulaski counties

+# Shanks partitioned Indiana into 345 regions, each with its own time history,
+# and wrote ``Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.''
+# Those Hoosiers!  Such a flighty and changeable people!
+# Fortunately, most of the complexity occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.
+#
 # Other than Indianapolis, the Indiana place names are so nondescript
 # that they would be ambiguous if we left them at the `America' level.
 # So we reluctantly put them all in a subdirectory `America/Indiana'.
-#
-# Most of EST-only Indiana last observed DST in 1970.
 
-# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06), following a tip by Markus Kuhn:
-# Pam Belluck reported in the New York Times (2001-01-31) that the
-# Indiana Legislature is considering a bill to adopt DST statewide.
-# Her article mentioned Vevay, whose post office observes a different
-# time zone from Danner's Hardware across the street.
+# From Paul Eggert (2005-08-16):
+# http://www.mccsc.edu/time.html says that Indiana will use DST starting 2006.

+# From Paul Eggert (2006-01-20):
+# It says "DOT is relocating the time zone boundary in Indiana to move Starke,
+# Pulaski, Knox, Daviess, Martin, Pike, Dubois, and Perry Counties from the
+# Eastern Time Zone to the Central Time Zone.... The effective date of
+# this rule is 2:OO a.m. EST Sunday, April 2, 2006, which is the
+# changeover date from standard time to Daylight Saving Time."
+# Strictly speaking, this means the affected counties will change their
+# clocks twice that night, but this obviously is in error.  The intent
+# is that 01:59:59 EST be followed by 02:00:00 CDT.
