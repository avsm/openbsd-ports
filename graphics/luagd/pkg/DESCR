LuaGD is a set of Lua bindings to the Thomas Boutell's gd library that
allows your code to quickly draw complete images with lines, polygons,
arcs, text, multiple colors, cut and paste from other images, flood
fills, read in or write out images in the PNG or JPEG formats. It is not
a kitchen-sink graphics package, but it does include most frequently
requested features, including both truecolor and palette images,
resampling (smooth resizing of truecolor images) and so forth. It is
particularly useful in Web applications.
