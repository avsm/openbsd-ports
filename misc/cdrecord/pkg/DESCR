This is Version 1.6.1 of cdrecord

Cdrecord allows you to create CD's on a CD-Recorder.
Cdrecord runs on:

SunOS 4.1.3 or later:	sparc.
Solaris 2.3 or later:	sparc and x86.
Linux:			x86 sparc ppc and alpha.
NetBSD/FreeBSD/OpenBSD:	x86 sparc			<----
SGI IRIX:		mips
HP-UX:			hppa
AIX:			rs6000
OSF1:			alpha

For multi session please read README.multi

Cdrecord runs without problems on a loded Solaris system.
On SunOS, Linux and other systems without realtime scheduler you have to test.

Cdrecord has been designed with a similar user interface as cdwrite
written by
	Adam J. Richter <adam@yggdrasil.com>
now maintained by
	H. Peter Anvin <hpa@transmeta.com>
but the dev= option is slightly different for portability.

The cdrecord distribution contains a SCSI user level transport library.
The SCSI library is suitable to talk to any SCSI device without having
a special driver for it.
Cdrecord may be easily ported to any system that has a 
SCSI device driver similar to the scg driver.

On *BSD, SGI IRIX and HP-UX the internal user level SCSI driver is used
but you will not need an OS specific SCSI user library.

Cdrecord has been implemented with a Philips CDD 521.
Cdrecord now is maintained with the following drives:

	COMPRO/Matsushita/Panasonic CW-7502
	Philips CDD-2000
	TEAC CD-R55S
	Yamaha CDR-400

All companies that support me with SCSI command reference manuals and drives
will get (continued) support in the following releases.

The following drives will never be supported by cdrecord because they are too old:

	JVC XR-W1001
	Pinnacle Micro RCD-202
	Ricoh RS-9200CD

The following dries are curently not supported because I don't get specs:
(some of them may partially work: see above)
