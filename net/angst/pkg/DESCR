Angst is an active sniffer, based on libpcap and libnet.  Angst provides
methods for aggressive sniffing on switched local area network environments.
It dumps the payload of all the TCP packets received on the specified ports.
Moreover, it implements methods for active sniffing.  Angst currently provides
two active sniffing methods.  The first monitors ARP requests, and after
enabling IP forwarding on the local host, sends ARP replies mapping all IPs
to the local MAC address.  The second method floods the local network with
random MAC addresses (like macof v1.1 by Ian Vitek), causing switches to send
packets to all ports.  Made just for testing purposes and fun.  If you compile
it on any other platform except the ones listed below, please contact me at the
above email address.  As always, published under a BSD style license, see the
