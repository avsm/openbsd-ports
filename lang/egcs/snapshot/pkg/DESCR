egcs is an experimental spin-off of gcc that started when people got 
fed up waiting for gcc 2.8. As the C++ standard finally emerged,
egcs people strove trying to implement as much of it as possible.

Egcs proved to be a successful project, to the extent that it now is
the official gnu compiler, relabelled gcc 2.95 for its first release.

OpenBSD 2.7 ships with gcc 2.95.2, which should be adequate for most
people.

The main reason for the egcs/snapshot port is to make it easier for 
interested parties to track current egcs development and report bugs
(specific or not to OpenBSD), so that when the next release comes, we
are ready to integrate it.

From a user point of view, you may need some features that the port
provides.

There have been a lot of changes since gcc 2.95.2, this is just a quick
summary of a few:

* the intel scheduler has been revamped. It's more efficient on hundreds
of little details,
* other arches have known important internal improvement. m68k pic support
should be better. HP-PA has most of PA2.0 support in,
* internal memory handling now uses a garbage collector. Eventually egcs
should become faster, more robust and less memory-hungry (this is already 
the case in many circumstances),
* the back-end specifications have been tightened, so that many bugs have
been found,
* the C++ compiler now uses one-function-at-a-time tree representations.
More optimizations are possible,
* the design of varargs facilities has been completely changed,
* loads of new warnings and new optimizations.
