You must add the ${PREFIX}/share/bochs/fonts directory to your X server's
font path.  For XFree86, add the line:

FontPath "${PREFIX}/share/bochs/fonts"

in the "Files" section of your XF86Config file.  This is /etc/XF86Config
for XFree86 version 3, and /etc/X11/XF86Config for XFree86 version 4.
If you use a different X server, please see its documentation on how to do
this.

Then re-start your X server.
