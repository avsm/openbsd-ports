This port only contains plugins from the GPL Feed, but neither from the
Direct Feed nor from the Registered Feed.

For mor informations about feeds, see:
http://www.nessus.org/plugins/index.php?view=feed

Some of the checks performed by nessus rely on external programs like
hydra, nmap 3.00 or newer, and nikto. You may want to install these
ports to enable some checks which will otherwise return false negatives.
