Quake is a 3D action game, which can be played both single-user as multi-
user. This package holds binaries for Quake, QuakeWorld.

Note that you must have quake datafiles from elsewhere.

System wide data directory  : ${PREFIX}/share/quakeforge
Per-user game data directory: ~/.quakeforge

One of those directories should contain the following:

./id1/
./id1/pak0.pak
./id1/pak1.pak
./id1/config.cfg

You can optionally also have the following:

./rogue/
./rogue/pak0.pak
./rogue/config.cfg
./hipnotic/
./hipnotic/pak0.pak
