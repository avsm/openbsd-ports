ZSyncer is a Zope 2 product that allows you to synchronize and compare
objects from one zope (source) to another (destination).  It is a lot
more convenient than the old manual export/transfer/import procedure.

ZSyncer supports SSL as well as insecure HTTP.

ZSyncer also allows you to view a diff against the destination object,
for many types of objects.
