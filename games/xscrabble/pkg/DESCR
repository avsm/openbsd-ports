To run:

Simply type xscrabble. This will bring up the setup box which will allow
you to enter the names and displays and other info for the game to wish
to play. Then click on the Start Game button, (or Load Previous if you're
restarting a game). The main program, xscrab, will then be automatically
called with the appropriate options.

The game is saved after every turn (in "~/.xscrabble.save" of the
person running it) and can be restarted by running xscrabble, entering
exactly the same info, and hitting the Load Previous button.

This was a student project, and there are not likely to be any future
releases.

Have fun,

Matt Chapman.
