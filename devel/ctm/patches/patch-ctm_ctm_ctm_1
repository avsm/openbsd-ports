 .Ss Usage
-
 To apply a CTM delta, you pass it to the
-.Nm ctm
+.Nm
 command.  You can pass a CTM delta on stdin, or you can give the
 filename as an argument.  If you do the latter, you make life a lot

+should/should not exist and by checking the MD5 checksums of files.
 
-Pass 3 will actually apply the delta.
+If a
+.Ar backup-file
+had been specified using the 
+.Fl B
+option, all files that would be modified by this 
+.Nm
+invocation are backed up
+to this file using the archiver command specified by the 
+.Fl t
+option.  The default archiver command is
+.Nm "tar -rf %s -T -" .

+Pass 3 will actually apply the delta. 
+
+The list of files that would be modified by

+is subject to filtering regular expressions specified
+using the
+.Fl e

+options.
+The
+.Fl e
+and

+filter that matched a given file name determines whether the file would be 
+operated on or left alone by
