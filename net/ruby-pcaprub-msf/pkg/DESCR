This goal of this project is to provide a consistent interface to LBL's
libpcap packet capture library. This project was created because the
currently available ruby-pcap library is poorly designed and has been
unmaintained since 2000. This does not provide packet processing
functionality, it simply provides the interface for capturing packets.

This version has been forked by the Metasploit project.
