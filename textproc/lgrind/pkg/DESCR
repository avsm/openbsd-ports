LGrind - source pretty printer for LaTeX

Welcome to LGrind. LGrind is a descendant of the Unix utility vgrind. It is
used to produce a beautified version of your source code using LaTeX.
Unlike other packages this is not pure TeX but an external preprocessor. 
You run e.g.
 lgrind example.c > example.tex
 latex example.tex
 to get a complete listing. Options for producing includable files
 and processing embedded listings in LaTeX documents are provided.
