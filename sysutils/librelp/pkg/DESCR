librelp is an implementation of RELP, Reliable Event Logging Protocol.
RELP assures that no message is lost, not even when connections break
and a peer becomes unavailable.

The current version of RELP has a minimal window of opportunity for
message duplication after a session has been broken due to network
problems. In this case, a few messages may be duplicated (a problem
that also exists with plain tcp syslog). Future versions of RELP
will address this shortcoming.
