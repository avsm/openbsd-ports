The goal of GAMGI is to provide a free package to construct, view and
analyse atomic structures, as powerful and simple to use as possible.

GAMGI aims to be useful for: 1) the scientific community working in
atomistic modelling, who needs a graphic interface to build and analyse
atomic structures; 2) the scientific community at large, who needs a
graphic interface to study atomic structures and to prepare images for
presentations; 3) teaching the atomic structure of matter in schools and
universities, even inviting students to run GAMGI at home; 4) science
promotion, in exhibitions and science museums.
