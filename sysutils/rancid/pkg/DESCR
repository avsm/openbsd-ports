RANCID monitors a router's (or more generally a device's)
configuration, including software and hardware (cards, serial numbers,
etc) and uses CVS (Concurrent Version System) to maintain history of 
changes.

RANCID does this by the very simple process summarized here:
	* login to each device in the router table (router.db) 
	* run various commands to get the information that will be saved 
	* cook the output; re-format, remove oscillating or incrementing data 
	* email any differences (sample) from the previous collection to a
	  mail list 
	* and finally commit those changes to the revision control system
