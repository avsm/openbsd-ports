System Preferences is an application which allows to manage the settings
of many aspects of the gnustep environment and its applications.  System
Preferences are made of Modules, each one a bundle representing a single
control panel, and is thus extensible and modular.  Technically, it is a
clone of the Apple OS X System Preferences and offers a compatible
framework.
