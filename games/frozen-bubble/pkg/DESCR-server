The Frozen-Bubble server is a standalone program acting as a bridge
between Frozen-Bubble clients (where the players are). It uses the IP
protocol thus players need Internet connectivity (though it's possible
to play LAN games on a LAN with IP support but no Internet
connectivity). It has some logic to control creating and joining a
game, and then becomes a pure relay for in-game information
communicated between players.
