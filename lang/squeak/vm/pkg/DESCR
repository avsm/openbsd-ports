Squeak is a comprehensive smalltalk 80 system, that was originally
fostered by Apple and Disney.

It also needs an image to work, OpenBSD packages a selection of images
that can be installed, and that will be available under 
${SQUEAK_DIR}

For any serious development, you will have to copy the image in your
workdir to record new changes.

Refer to the web site for other images.
