Installing SymbolType (using "easy_install SymbolType" or "setup.py
install") gives you access to the peak.util.symbols module, previously
available only by installing the full PEAK toolkit. peak.util.symbols
provides a Symbol type and two built-in symbols that are used by
PEAK: NOT_FOUND and NOT_GIVEN.
