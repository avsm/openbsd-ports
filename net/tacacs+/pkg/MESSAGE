+------------
| TACACS+ requires root privileges to start up properly. After the
| initialization, it will drop privileges to a less-privileged
| user/group called '${TACACSUSER}'.
| 
| Please edit /etc/services and add the following entry:
|
| tacacs+	49/tcp
|
+------------
| WARNING!
|
| This port has changed its user/group from 'tacacs' to '_tacacs'. If you
| installed this port before, ensure all permissions are set correctly and
| then "rmuser tacacs".
