SYMPA is an electronic mailing list manager. It is used to automate list
management functions such as subscription, moderation and management of
archives. SYMPA also manages sending of messages to the lists, and makes
it possible to reduce the load on the system. Provided that you have
enough memory on your system, Sympa is especially well adapted for big
lists.
