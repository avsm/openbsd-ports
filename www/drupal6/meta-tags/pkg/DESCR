This module allows you to set some meta tags for each node, view
or panels page.

Giving more attention to the important keywords and/or description
on some of your nodes allows you to get better search engine
positioning (given that you really only provide the keywords which
exist in the node body itself, and do not try to lie).

The module may also be known under following names: nodewords or
node (key)words. Meta tags is the preferred name.
