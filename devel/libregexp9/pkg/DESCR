Libregexp9 is a port of Plan 9's regexp library.
It is small and simple and provides the traditional
extended regular expressions (as opposed to the
current extended regular expressions, which add {}
and various \x character classes, among other 
complications).

It handles Unicode in wide character or UTF8 format!
