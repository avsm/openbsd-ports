If you are updating from a previous version of webalizer, please note
that this package is now based on webalizer xtended(sic), an extended
version of the original webalizer code that supports additional features,
most notably detailed http 404 error reports and IPv6 support.

The webalizer.current file format has changed, please remove any
existing such files from your statistics directories if you are using
the webalizer in incremental mode or convert them with the following
command:

echo -e "0\n# -notfounderrors- \n# End Of Table - notfounderrors" >> \
    webalizer.current
