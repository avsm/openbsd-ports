State Threads is an application library which provides a foundation
for writing fast and highly scalable Internet Applications on
UNIX-like platforms. It combines the simplicity of the multithreaded
programming paradigm, in which one thread supports each simultaneous
connection, with the performance and scalability of an event-driven
state machine architecture.
