This Haskell module merely imports and re-exports the common part
of the new api: "Text.Regex.Base.RegexLike" and "Text.Regex.Base.Context".

To see what result types the instances of RegexContext can produce,
please read the "Text.Regex.Base.Context" haddock documentation.

This does not provide any of the backends, just the common interface
they all use.  The modules which provide the backends and their cabal
packages are:

 * @Text.Regex.Posix@ from regex-posix
 * @Text.Regex@ from regex-compat (uses regex-posix)
 * @Text.Regex.Parsec@ from regex-parsec
 * @Text.Regex.DFA@ from regex-dfa
 * @Text.Regex.PCRE@ from regex-pcre
 * @Test.Regex.TRE@ from regex-tre

In fact, just importing one of the backends is adequate, you do not
also need to import this module.
