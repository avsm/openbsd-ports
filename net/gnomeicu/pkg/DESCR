GnomeICU is a program based on Mirabilis' ICQ protocol, and designed for use
with the Gtk+ widget library.  It is meant to be a high speed, high quality
alternative for Mirabilis' Java client (Mirabilis' only attempt at a Linux
client).  Though GnomeICU is quite stable at this time, it is still
development software, and most certainly contains bugs.
