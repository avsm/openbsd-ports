This is Version 1.6a7 of cdrecord

Cdrecord allows you to create CD's on a CD-Recorder.

For multi session please read README.multi

Cdrecord has been designed with a similar user interface as cdwrite
written by
	Adam J. Richter <adam@yggdrasil.com>
now maintained by
	H. Peter Anvin <hpa@transmeta.com>
but the dev= option is slightly different for portability.

The cdrecord distribution contains a SCSI user level transport library.
The SCSI library is suitable to talk to any SCSI device without having
a special driver for it.

Cdrecord has been implemented with a Philips CDD 521.
Cdrecord now is maintained with a Philips CDD-2000
