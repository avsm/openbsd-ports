Bluetile is a tiling window manager for X based on xmonad. Windows
are arranged to use the entire screen without overlapping. Bluetile's
focus lies on making the tiling paradigm easily accessible to users
coming from traditional window managers by drawing on known conventions
and providing both mouse and keyboard access for all features. It
also tries to be usable 'out of the box', requiring minimal to no
configuration in most cases.
