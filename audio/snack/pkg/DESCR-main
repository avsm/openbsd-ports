The Snack Sound Toolkit is designed to be used with a scripting language
such as Tcl/Tk or Python.  Snack has commands for basic sound handling,
such as playback, recording, file and socket I/O.  Snack also provides
primitives for sound visualization, e.g. waveforms and spectrograms.  It
was developed mainly to handle digital recordings of speech, but is just
as useful for general audio.  Snack has also successfully been applied
to other one-dimensional signals.
