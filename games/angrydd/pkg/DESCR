In Angry, Drunken Dwarves, you are an angry, drunken dwarf. Why are you
so angry? Who knows.  But you've decided to take your aggression out on
other dwarves, by dropping gems on their heads. Lots of gems.  ADD is a
member of the classic "falling blocks" puzzle game family, similar to
the Capcom game Puzzle Fighter.  It has seven playable characters, six
levels of AI, secret game modes and characters, and an original
soundtrack.  The goal of the game is to build large gems by matching up
colors, then break them, raining more gems down onto your opponent.  The
first person whose field fills up, loses.
