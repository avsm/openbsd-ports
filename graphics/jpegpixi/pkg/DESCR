"Jpegpixi" is short for "JPEG pixel interpolator".  The intent of
the program is to interpolate pixels in JFIF images (commonly
referred to as "JPEG images").  This is useful to correct images
from a digital camera with CCD defects. For example, if one pixel
is always bright green, this pixel can be interpolated away with
jpegpixi.
