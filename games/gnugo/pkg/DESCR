The game of Go.

Currently, this program only understands basic Go rules and skills.
It counts the number of liberty for each board piece.  Computer move is
generated by choosing among several possible moves to attack the opponent,
defense own pieces and match playing patterns.  If no good move is found
then random move will be generated.  It doesn't have the concept of eye
although it will try to form one.
