Qt is a toolkit for building a GUI for X in C++. 
There are some user documentation files in ${QT_DOC}, but
the main documentation is in the qt3-html package, 
or on the web (${HOMEPAGE}).

There is also a qt3-examples package, that contains a tutorial and 
simple example programs (source + binaries).

On most architectures, you can find database plugins: qt3-mysql and
qt3-postgresql.
