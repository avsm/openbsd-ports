libpeas is a gobject-based plugins engine, and is targetted at giving
every application the chance to assume its own extensibility. It is
currently used by several GNOME applications like gedit and Totem.

It takes its roots in the old gedit plugins engine, and provides an
extensive set of features mirroring the desiderata of most of the
applications providing an extension framework.
