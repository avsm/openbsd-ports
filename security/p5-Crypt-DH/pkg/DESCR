Crypt::DH is a Perl implementation of the Diffie-Hellman key
exchange system. Diffie-Hellman is an algorithm by which two
parties can agree on a shared secret key, known only to them.
The secret is negotiated over an insecure network without the
two parties ever passing the actual shared secret, or their
private keys, between them.
