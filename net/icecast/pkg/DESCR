Icecast is a streaming media server which currently supports Ogg
Vorbis and MP3 audio streams. It can be used to create an Internet
radio station or a privately running jukebox and many things in
between. It is very versatile in that new formats can be added
relatively easily and supports open standards for communication and
interaction.

Icecast v2 is a complete rewrite of the old Icecast streaming server.
It was designed to be highly efficient and have low memory requirements.

Additional features are, among others:

   * a web-based administration interface including simple file serving
   * supports listing in stream directories
   * new relay system

After many years of development, testing and even production use,
Icecast v2 is also very stable.

Security features include chroot()ing and dropping privileges, if
configured to do so.
