Feldspar (Functional Embedded Language for DSP and PARallelism) is an
embedded DSL for describing digital signal processing algorithms. This
library (FeldsparCompiler) contains a prototype compiler that supports C
code generation from programs written in this language both according to
ANSI C and also targeted to a real DSP HW.
