To play nice with dhclient, read ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/doc/adsuck/README.dhclient
To have adsuck start at boot time, put something
like this in /etc/rc.conf.local:

 adsuck_flags="-c /var/adsuck -f /files/resolv.conf /files/hosts.small"

and like this in /etc/rc.local:

 if [ "$adsuck_flags" != "NO" -a -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/adsuck ]; then
	echo -n ' adsuck'; ${PREFIX}/sbin/adsuck $adsuck_flags
 fi

Also, be sure to set ${SYSCONFDIR}/resolv.conf to contain only one
nameserver line:

  nameserver 127.0.0.1
