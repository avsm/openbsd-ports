/*
 * OpenBSD program to set the magic bit in IBM Thinkpad BIOS that 
 * allows the use of any MiniPCI wireless card. Must be run as root. 
 * Tested on an X40, but may work on other Thinkpads with similar 
 * restrictions. OTOH Don't complain if it trashes your CMOS. 
 * This is a simple transliteration of the no-1802.com program found at 
 * http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~mjg59/thinkpad/hacks.html
