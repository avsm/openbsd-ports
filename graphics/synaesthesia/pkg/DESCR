This is a program for representing sounds visually.  It goes beyond
the usual oscilliscope style program by combining an FFT and stereo
positioning information to give a two dimensional display. Some of the
shapes I have observed are:
  * Drums: clouds of color, fairly high
  * Clean guitar: several horizontal lines, low down
  * Rough guitar: a cloud, low down
  * Trumpet: Lots of horizontal lines everywhere
  * Flute: A single horizontal line, low down
  * Voice: A vertical line with some internal structure
  * Synthesizer: All kinds of weird shapes!
