IJS is, first and foremost, a protocol for transmission of raster page
images. This snapshot provides a reference implementation of the
protocol, the design of which is still in flux. When the protocol
specification is published, it will be authoritative. Applications
should feel free to link against the library provided in this package,
adapt that code for their own needs, or roll a completely new
implementation.
