The Crypt::CipherSaber module implements CipherSaber encryption,
described at http://ciphersaber.gurus.com/. It is simple, fairly
speedy, and relatively secure algorithm based on RC4.
Encryption and decryption are done based on a secret key, which must
be shared with all intended recipients of a message.
