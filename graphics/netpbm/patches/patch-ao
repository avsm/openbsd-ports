+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.B pnmhisteq
+increases the contrast of a portable graymap or pixmap through the
+technique of
+.IR "histogram equalisation" [1].
+A histogram of the luminance of pixels in the map is computed, from
+which a transfer function is calculated which spreads out intensity levels
+around histogram peaks and compresses them at troughs.  This has the
+effect of using the available levels of intensity more efficiently and
+thereby increases the detail visible in the image.
+.PP
+Mathematically, if
+.I N[i]
+is the number of pixels of luminosity
+.I i
+in the image and
+.I T
+is the total number of pixels, luminosity
+.I j
+is replaced by:

+        \/
+        ---
+        i=0

+.FI
+.PP
+If you're processing a related set of images, for example frames of an
+animation, it's generally best to apply the same intensity map to
+every frame, since otherwise you'll get distracting frame-to-frame
+changes in the brightness of objects.
+.BR pnmhisteq 's
+.B \-wmap
+option
+allows you to save, as a portable graymap, the luminosity map computed
+from an image (usually a composite of the images you intend
+to process created with
+.BR pnmcat ).
+Then, you can subsequently process each of the individual images using
+the luminosity map saved in the file, supplied with the
+.B \-rmap
+option.
+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP 10
+.B \-gray
+When processing a pixmap, only gray pixels (those with identical red,
+green, and blue values) are included in the histogram and modified
+in the output image.  This is a special purpose option intended
+for images where the actual data are gray scale, with
+colour annotations you don't want modified.  Weather
+satellite images that show continent outlines in colour are best
+processed using this option.  The option has no effect when the input
+is a graymap.
+.TP
+.BI \-rmap " mapfile"
+Process the image using the luminosity map specified by the portable
+graymap
+.I mapfile.
+The graymap, usually created by an earlier run of
+.B pnmhisteq
+with the 
+.B \-wmap
+option, contains a single row with number of columns equal to
+the
+.I maxval
+(greatest intensity) of the image.  Each pixel in the image is
+transformed by looking up its luminosity in the corresponding
+column in the map file and changing it to the value
+given by that column.
+.TP
+.BI \-wmap " mapfile"
+Creates a portable graymap,
+.I mapfile,
+containing the luminosity map computed from the histogram of the
+input image.  This map file can be read on subsequent runs of
+.B pnmhisteq
+with the
+.B \-rmap
+option, allowing a group of images to be processed with
+an identical map.
+.TP
+.B \-verbose
+Prints the histogram and luminosity map on standard error.
+.PP
+All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
+.SH BUGS
+Histogram equalisation is effective for increasing the visible detail
+in scientific imagery and in some continuous-tone pictures.  It is
+often too drastic, however, for scanned halftone images, where it
+does an excellent job of making halftone artifacts apparent.  You
+might want to experiment with
+.BR pgnnorm ,
+.BR ppmnorm ,
+and
+.B pnmgamma
+for more subtle contrast enhancement.
+.PP
+The luminosity map file supplied by the
+.B \-rmap
+option must have the same
+.I maxval
+as the input image.  This is always the case when the
+map file was created by the
+.B \-wmap
+option of 
+.BR pnmhisteq .
+If this restriction causes a problem, simply adjust the
+.I maxval
+of the map with
+.B pnmdepth
+to agree with the input image.
+.PP
+If the input is a PBM file (on which histogram equalisation is an
+identity operation), the only effect of passing the file through
+.B pnmhisteq
+will be the passage of time.
