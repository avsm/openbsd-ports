The keychain shell script makes handling RSA and DSA keys both
convenient and secure. It acts as a front-end to ssh-agent, allowing
you to easily have one long-running ssh-agent process per system,
rather than per login session. This dramatically reduces the number
of times you need to enter your passphrase from once per new login
session to once every time your local machine is rebooted.
