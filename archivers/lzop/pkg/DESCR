lzop is a file compressor which is very similar to gzip.  It
uses the LZO library for compression services and  its  main
advantages  over gzip are much higher compression and decom-
pression speed (at the cost of some compression ratio).

lzop is distributed under the terms of the GNU General  Pub-
lic License (GPL).
