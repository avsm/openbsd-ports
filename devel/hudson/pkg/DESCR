Hudson is a continuous integration (CI) server (for information on CI
see http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html).
Written in Java and with a web-based configuration interface, Hudson
can be run standalone (contains its own tiny web server) or in any
standard Java-capable web server or application server.
