==============================================================
The configuration files for Courier-IMAP have been installed
in /usr/local/share/courier.

You should copy imapd.config and imapd-ssl.config to /etc,
and edit them to your site's needs.  

It is generally not a good idea to expose plain-text IMAP to
the outside world, so you can bind the plain-text one to 
127.0.0.1, and the SSL one to your external IP interface(s).
Don't forget to configure stunnel correctly before trying to
use the SSL facility of Courier.

To control the daemon use /usr/local/libexec/imapd.rc and
/usr/local/libexec/imapd-ssl.rc

More documentation is available at the Courier-IMAP homepage,
