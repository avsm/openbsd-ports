For detailed instructions on how to run Tomcat see:
${SAMPLEDIR}/webapps/tomcat-docs/index.html

For more information on application development with Tomcat, see
${SAMPLEDIR}/webapps/tomcat-docs/appdev/index.html

Note that Tomcat may be started with the following command:
$ sudo -u _tomcat ${PREFIX}/${PKGNAME}/bin/startup.sh

Configuration files are in `${SYSCONFDIR}/tomcat' (use tomcat.rc
for setting environment variables like JAVA_HOME/JAVA_OPTS/...)

`$CATALINA_BASE' is `/var/tomcat'.

See also ${PREFIX}/${PKGNAME}/README.OpenBSD for information
