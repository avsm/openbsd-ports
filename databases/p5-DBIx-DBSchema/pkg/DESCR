This module implements an OO-interface to database schemas. Using this
module, you can create a database schema with an OO Perl interface. You
can read the schema from an existing database. You can save the schema
to disk and restore it a different process. Most importantly,
DBIx::DBSchema can write SQL CREATE statements statements for different
databases from a single source.
