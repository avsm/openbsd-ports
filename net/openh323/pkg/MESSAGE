To be able to use the H.263 codec (from FFmpeg), you must create a link
from ${LOCALBASE}/lib/libavcodec.so.X.Y to
${LOCALBASE}/lib/pwlib/libavcodec.so so that it can be loaded as a
run-time module by OpenH323.
To do so run the following command as root:

 ln -sf ${LOCALBASE}/lib/libavcodec.so.X.Y ${LOCALBASE}/lib/pwlib/libavcodec.so

where X and Y are the corresponding major and minor version numbers.
