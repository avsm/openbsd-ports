The KDE-PIM project aims to bring together those who wish to help design,
implement, test, etc. anything that's to do with personal information
management.

This rather broad scope encompasses mail clients, addressbooks, usenet news,
scheduling and even sticky notes.

* kaddressbook: The KDE addressbook application.
* kmail: the KDE mail client
* kmailcvt: tool for importing mail related data from other programs
* knode: news client
* korganizer: a calendar-of-events and todo-list manager
* kalarm: gui for setting up personal alarm messages, emails and commands
* kalarmd: alarm monitoring daemon, shared by korganizer and kalarm.
* kontact: Integrated PIM application
* karm: Time tracker.
* kfile-plugins: vCard KFIleItem plugin.
* knotes: yellow notes application
* konsolecalendar: Command line tool for accessing calendar files.
* korn: mail checker
* akregator: Feed reader

There is also quite an amount of infrastructure in this package:

* calendarsystem: library for handling of non-gregorian calendar systems
* libkdepim: Common code for different kdepim apps
* libkdenetwork: Common code for apps previously being in the kdenetwork CVS
                 module (KMail, KNode). This will be merged with libkdepim.
* mimelib: MIME messages library
* libkpimexchange: connecting to Exchange2000 servers
* kabc/frontend: A GUI frontend for libkabc, not intended for end users.
* kdgantt: alternative lib for Gantt diagrams, used by the free/busy view of
           KOrganizer (yes, we should decide for one of the Gantt libs)
* kioslaves/sieve: Sieve kioslave
