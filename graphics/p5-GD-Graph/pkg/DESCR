GD::Graph is a Perl module to create charts using the GD module.
The following classes for graphs with axes are defined:

GD::Graph::lines -  Create a line chart.

GD::Graph::bars - Create a bar chart.

GD::Graph::points - Create an chart, displaying the data as points.

GD::Graph::linespoints - Combination of lines and points.

GD::Graph::area - Create a graph, representing the data as areas
under a line.

GD::Graph::mixed - Create a mixed type graph, any combination of
the above. At the moment this is fairly limited. Some of the options
that can be used with some of the individual graph types won't work
very well. Multiple bar graphs in a mixed graph won't display very
nicely.
