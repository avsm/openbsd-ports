gnome-keyring-query has the capability to store and retrieve simple
name/passphrase pairs in the default keyring. Unlike applications like
Nautilus and Evolution, no additional fields are stored, with the
exception of a 'magic' field to distinguish keys created by
gnome-keyring-query from those created by other applications.
