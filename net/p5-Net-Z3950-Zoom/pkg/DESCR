This distribution contains three Perl modules for the price of one.
They all provide facilities for building information retrieval clients
using the standard Z39.50 and SRW/U protocols, but do so using
different APIs.

- If you are new to this distribution, then you should use the ZOOM
  API, and ignore the others.  It is the cleanest, most elegant and
  intuitive, and most closely follows the letter as well as the spirit
  of the Abstract ZOOM API as specified at http://zoom.z3950.org/api/

- If you have used the old Net::Z3950 module and have to maintain an
  application that calls that API, then you will want to use the
  Net::Z3950 classes provided in this distribution, which provide an
  API compatible with the old module's implemented on top of the new
  ZOOM code.

- You should definitely not use the Net::Z3950::ZOOM API, which is not
  object-oriented, and instead provides the thinnest possible layer on
  top of the ZOOM-C functions in the YAZ toolkit.  This API exists
  only in order to have ZOOM API built on top of it.
