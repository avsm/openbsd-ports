security precautions taken, as recommended by the postfix INSTALL doc:

installed with postdrop setgid, to eliminate the world-writable
postdrop vulnerability (local users can present a denial of service).

all daemons chrooted in /var/spool/postfix.

separate postfix user and group, and postdrop group.

-d.
