gstreamermm provides C++ bindings for the GStreamer streaming multimedia
library.  With gstreamermm it is possible to develop applications that
work with multimedia in C++.

gstreamermm is developed over glibmm, libsigc++ and libxml++ and the
functionalities they provide.  This means that, among other things,
referencing and unreferencing of GObjects is handled automatically via
glibmm's automatic pointer class, Glib:RefPtr<>, and libsigc++'s slots
are used for callbacks and signals.
