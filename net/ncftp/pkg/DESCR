NcFTP is a free set of programs that use the File Transfer Protocol.
The main program is simply called "ncftp".  There are also separate
utility programs for one-shot FTP operations (i.e. for shell scripts
and command line junkies);  these include "ncftpget", "ncftpput",
and "ncftpls".  Also included is a batch processing daemon,
"ncftpbatch".  There is also "ncftpspooler" which can be used as a
system-wide FTP spooler.  Lastly, the "ncftpbookmarks" program is
a full-screen utility program to manipulate users' FTP bookmarks.
