Todo is a program to display and manage a hierarchical list of outstanding 
work, or just reminders.

The program itself is assisted by a few shell scripts that override default
builtins. Specifically, cd, pushd and popd are overridden so that when using
one of these commands to enter a directory, the todo will display any
outstanding items in that directory.
