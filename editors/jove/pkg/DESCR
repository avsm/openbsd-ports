Jove is a simple text editor in the spirit of GNU emacs, but somewhat
smaller and faster to start up.

There are man pages for jove and teachjove.  Teachjove is for people who
have never used EMACS style editors.  It is an interactive tutorial, THE
tutorial written by Stallman for the original EMACS, only slightly
modified for JOVE in the appropriate places.  The man pages are
completely up to date, thanks to me.
