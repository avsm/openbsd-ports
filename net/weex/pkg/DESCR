Weex is a utility designed to automate the task of remotely maintaining
a web page or other FTP archive.  With weex, the maintainer of a
web site or archive that must be administered through FTP interaction
can largely ignore that process.  The archive administrator simply
creates a local directory that serves as an exact model for the
offsite data.  All modifications and direct interaction is done
locally to this directory structure.  When the administrator wishes
to coordinate the data on the remote site with that of the local
model directory, simply executing weex accomplishes this in the
most bandwidth-efficient fashion by only transferring files that
need updating.  The program will create or remove (!) files or
directories as necessary to accurately establish the local model
on the remote server.
