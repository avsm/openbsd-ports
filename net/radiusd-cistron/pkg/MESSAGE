+---------------
| The RADIUS configuration files belong in /etc/raddb.  Examples
| and extra documentation can be found in the following locations:
|
|     /usr/local/share/examples/radiusd-cistron
|     /usr/local/share/doc/radiusd-cistron.
|
| You will need to edit /etc/rc.local as appropriate and add a
| section similiar to the following:
|
|     if [ -x /usr/local/sbin/radiusd ]; then
|             /usr/local/sbin/radiusd -y && echo -n ' radiusd'
|     fi
|
|     (see radiusd(8) for available options)
