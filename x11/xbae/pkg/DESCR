XbaeMatrix is a free Motif(R) table widget (also compatible with
the free LessTif) which presents an editable array of string data
to the user in a scrollable table similar to a spreadsheet. The
rows and columns of the Matrix may optionally be labelled. A number
of "fixed" and "trailing fixed" rows or columns may be specified.
