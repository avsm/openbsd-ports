CUPS provides a portable printing layer for UNIX(r)-based
operating systems.  CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley
command-line interfaces.

CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol ("IPP") as the basis
for managing print jobs and queues.  The Line Printer Daemon
("LPD") Server Message Block ("SMB"), and AppSocket (a.k.a.
JetDirect) protocols are also supported with reduced
functionality.  CUPS adds network printer browsing and
PostScript Printer Description ("PPD") based printing options to
support real-world printing under UNIX.
