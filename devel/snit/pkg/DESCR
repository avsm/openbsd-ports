Snit is pure-Tcl object and megawidget framework written entirely in
Tcl. Unlike most Tcl object systems, it isn't based on object
inheritance; relying on inheritance only ties you down to the object
system you've chosen.  Instead, Snit is all about delegation: an object
type can define its own methods and options, but it can easily delegate
methods and options to other kinds of object.
