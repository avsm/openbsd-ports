The Glasgow Haskell Compiler is a state-of-the-art, open source, compiler and
interactive environment for the functional language Haskell. Highlights:

   * GHC supports the entire Haskell 98 language plus a wide variety of
     extensions.
   * GHC works on several platforms including Windows and a few varieties of
     Unix, and a few different processor architectures. There are detailed
     instructions for porting GHC to a new platform. Which doesn't work.
   * GHC has extensive optimisation capabilities, including inter-module
     optimisation.
   * GHC compiles Haskell code either by using an intermediate C compiler
     (GCC), or by generating native code on most currently supported
     platforms. The interactive environment compiles Haskell to
     bytecode, and supports execution of mixed bytecode/compiled
     programs.
   * Profiling is supported, both by time/allocation and various kinds of
     heap profiling.
   * GHC comes with a minimal range of libraries, but a wide range of
     additional libraries are available as separate packages, including
     the full set of the Haskell Platform.
