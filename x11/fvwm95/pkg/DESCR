Fvwm95 is a hack based on fvwm2.x. It tries to emulate the good features of a 
well known product without bloating the regular fvwm code.

The main aspects are:

*  A familiar look and feel. It can be interesting for users moving from the 
   MS-World to Unix, or for those who have to switch regularly between the two. 
   Or for those that simply would like to have the same MS look and feel in 
   Unix, or for those that just want to have another window manager, or... But 
   before all, it's meant to be useful, simple and efficient.

*  Same flexible and easy configuration as the native fvwm.

*  Functionality extensible via loadable modules.

*  A taskbar: find quickly an application window and don't take space with icon
   windows.
