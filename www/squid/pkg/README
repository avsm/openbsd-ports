Running Squid on OpenBSD
========================

The local (OpenBSD) differences are:
- configuration files are in		${SYSCONFDIR}/squid
- sample configuration files are in	${TRUEPREFIX}/share/examples/squid
- error message files are in		${TRUEPREFIX}/share/squid/errors
- sample error message files are in	${TRUEPREFIX}/share/examples/squid/errors
- icons are in				${TRUEPREFIX}/share/squid/icons
- sample icons are in			${TRUEPREFIX}/share/examples/squid/icons
- the cache is in			${SQUIDDIR}/cache
- logs are stored in			${SQUIDDIR}/logs
- the ugid squid runs as is		_squid:_squid

Please remember to initialize the cache by running "squid -z" before
trying to run Squid for the first time.

Transparent Proxying with PF
----------------------------

To configure a transparent proxy, bind to a specific address in
${SYSCONFDIR}/squid/squid.conf, for example:

http_port 127.0.0.1:3127 transparent

On the machine running Squid, add a firewall rule similar to this:

pass in quick log inet proto tcp to port 80 divert-to 127.0.0.1 port 3127

If Squid is running on a machine which doesn't normally handle the
traffic (e.g. if you have a firewall and would like to divert packets
to Squid on another machine) you will also need a rule like this:

pass in quick from 10.77.3.5
pass in quick inet proto tcp to port 80 route-to (vr2 10.77.3.5)

(this example assumes Squid is running on 10.77.3.5 reachable over
the vr2 interface).
