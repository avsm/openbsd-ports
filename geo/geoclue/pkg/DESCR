Geoclue is a modular geoinformation service built on top of the D-Bus
messaging system. The goal of the Geoclue project is to make creating
location-aware applications as simple as possible.

Geoclue defines a set of geoinformation APIs, but it also includes some
providers that implement those APIs.
