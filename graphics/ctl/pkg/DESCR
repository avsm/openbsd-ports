The Color Transformation Language, or "CTL," is a portable and
platform-independent scripting language and interpreter, is intended to
be used as a building block for color management systems as well as for
sharing transforms in a common format.

CTL addresses an industry need to precisely and unambiguously describe
and share color transforms that are routinely used in motion picture
mastering. For example, transformations between various color spaces and
film density encodings can be defined in a CTL program that can be
delivered along with image data, thus ensuring the image is properly
rendered for display or other processing steps.
