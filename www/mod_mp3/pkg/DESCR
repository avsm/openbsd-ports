mod_mp3 turns the Apache Web Server into an MP3 or Ogg streaming server.
It can play from a list of files, either in order or randomly.  It can
also be used to cache MP3s into memory and have the server operate
entirely from memory.

Available flavors:
  mysql	     - Fetch data from MySQL database.
  postgresql - Fetch data from PostgreSQL database.
