This module provides methods implementing the IMAP protocol. It
allows perl scripts to interact with IMAP message stores.

The module is used by constructing or instantiating a new IMAPClient
object via the new constructor method. Once the object has been
instantiated, the connect method is either implicitly or explicitly
called.

At that point methods are available that implement the IMAP client
commands as specified in RFC2060. When processing is complete, the
logoff object method is called, either explicitly by the program
or implicitly when the object goes out of scope (or at program
termination).
