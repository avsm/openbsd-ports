AICCU makes it very easy for anybody to get IPv6 connectivity
everywhere they want. It uses the TIC (Tunnel Information & Control)
protocol to request the information needed to setup a tunnel through
which the connectivity is created.

AICCU supports the following tunneling protocols:
 - 6in4 static    (RFC 2893)
 - 6in4 heartbeat (RFC 2893 + draft-massar-v6ops-heartbeat)
 - tinc           (http://www.tinc-vpn.org)
 - AYIYA          (draft-massar-v6ops-ayiya)

As AYIYA even works from behind NAT's, thus unless there is a very
restrictive firewall in place, anybody should be able to get IPv6
connectivity without problems and everywhere they want.

One does need a SixXS account and at least a tunnel. These
can be freely & gratis requested from the SixXS website.
