gtk-vnc is a project providing client side APIs for the RFB protocol /
VNC remote desktop technology.

It is built using coroutines allowing it to be completely asynchronous
while remaining single threaded. It provides two core C libraries,
libgvnc for interacting with the core RFB protocol and libgtk-vnc for a
GTK display widget.
