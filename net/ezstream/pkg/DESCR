Ezstream is a command line source client for Icecast media streaming servers.

In its basic mode of operation, it streams media files or data from standard
input without reencoding and thus requires only very little CPU resources. It
can also use various external decoders and encoders to reencode from one
format to another, and stream the result to an Icecast server. Additional
features include scriptable playlist and metadata handling. All of its
features make ezstream a very flexible source client.

Supported media formats for streaming are MP3, Ogg Vorbis and Ogg Theora.
Metadata is supported through TagLib, which can read information from many
media file formats.
