XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) Transformations) is a
language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents.
It is a standard defined by The World Wide Web consortium (W3C).
Information about XSLT and related technologies can be found at
http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt.

This PHP extension provides a processor independent API to XSLT
transformations. Currently this extension only supports the Sablotron
library from the Ginger Alliance. Support is planned for other
libraries, such as the Xalan library or the libxslt library.
