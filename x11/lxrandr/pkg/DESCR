LXRandR is a very basic monitor config tool utilizing X RandR extension.
It's a GUI frontend of the command line program xrandr. LXRandR can let
you change the screen resolution on the fly. Besides, when you run
lxrandr with external monitor connected, its GUI will change, and show
you some quick options to get your projector working correctly.

This tool doesn't aim to be a full xrandr frontend. It's utility for
grandma, not for geeks.  LXRandR only gives you some easy and quick
options which are intuitive. It's very suitable for laptop users who
frequently uses projectors or external monitor and just want to get
their work done without reading a lot of "geek-centered" manuals or
command line tutorials.
