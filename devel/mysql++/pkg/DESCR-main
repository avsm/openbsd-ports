MySQL++ is a C++ wrapper for MySQL's C API. It is built around STL
principles, to make dealing with the database as easy as dealing
with an STL container. MySQL++ relieves the programmer of dealing
with cumbersome C data structures, generation of repetitive SQL
statements, and manual creation of C++ data structures to mirror
the database schema.
