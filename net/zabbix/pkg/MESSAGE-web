The Zabbix web frontend has been installed into
${PREFIX-web}/zabbix

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
    # ln -s ../zabbix /var/www/htdocs/zabbix
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

zabbix-web frontend can use a PostgreSQL, MySQL or SQLite3 database.
Install the php5-pgsql, php5-mysql or php5-pdo_sqlite package according
to the one you wish to use.
