GRAMPS is the Genealogical Research and Analysis Management Program
System. In other words, it is a personal genealogy program letting you
store, edit, and research genealogical data using the powers of your
computer.
GRAMPS makes every effort to maintain compatibility with GEDCOM, the
general standard of recording genealogical information. We have import
and export filters that enable GRAMPS to read and write GEDCOM files.
