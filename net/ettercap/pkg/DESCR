Ettercap is a multipurpose sniffer/interceptor/logger for switched
LAN.  It supports active and passive dissection of many protocols
(even ciphered ones) and includes many feature for network and host
analysis. 

It's possible to sniff in four modes.

+ IP Based, the packets are filtered on IP source and destination
+ MAC Based, packets filtered on mac address, useful to sniff
  connections through gateway
+ ARP based, uses arp poisoning to sniff in switched lan between
  two hosts (full-duplex).
+ PublicARP based, uses arp poisoning to sniff in switched LAN
  from a victim host to all other hosts (half-duplex).
