Trac is an enhanced wiki and issue tracking system for software development
projects. Trac uses a minimalistic approach to web-based software project
management. Our mission; to help developers write great software while
staying out of the way. Trac should impose as little as possible on a
team's established development process and policies.

It provides an interface to Subversion, an integrated Wiki and convenient
report facilities.
