The lua language function io_tmpname() uses the ANSI C function
tmpnam().  It can be difficult to use this function securely, but
since Lua is only implemented using strict ANSI C, an alternative
is not possible.

Because the fileopen() primitive is a wrapper to fopen(), you simply
should not use the tmpnam function.  It is impossible to use properly
with only fopen() functionality.  This applies to all platforms,
not just OpenBSD.  An attacker could possibly use a race attack to
replace your /tmp file with a symlink or a file they own.
