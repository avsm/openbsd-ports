** Attention for this ports file **

	   To use DHCP, your kernel must be rebuilt with the following
	line added to your kernel config file (/sys/i386/conf/<YourMachine>):

pseudo-device	bpfilter	4	#Berkeley packet filter

	and make bpf devices in your /dev directory: /dev/bpf[1-3].

cd /dev
./MAKEDEV bpf1
./MAKEDEV bpf2
./MAKEDEV bpf3

** dhcpdb.relay file is need without relay agent **

	  Please read more information in
	/usr/local/share/doc/dhcp/intro.dhcp or intro.dhcp.jis.

** CHECK_SUM Problem under FreeBSD 2.1.x **

	  This port collection is use tzfile.h from FreeBSD-current source
	tree. Because this file is frequently changed, md5 check sum of
	this file in files/md5 is ``IGNORE''.

	  If you use this port collection ***under FreeBSD 2.1-stable***:
	2.1.0-RELEASE, 2.1.5-RELASE, 2.1.6-RELEASE, 2.1.7-RELEASE,
	please use latest bsd.ports.mk and bsd.port.subdir.mk files in
	/usr/share/mk or manually check checksum and delete files/md5
	file.

** kernel dependence of package program files **

	  This compiled programs(packages) depends on kernel table as
	ifconfig program.
	  So please use fit package to your FreeBSD (for example under
	2.1.5-RELEASE, use packages-2.1.5, do not use packages-2.2) or
	recompile from ports collection.

** additional function **

	   DHCP client(dhcpc) in this port is supported "dynamic change
	/etc/resolv.conf and hostname via DHCP infomation".

		  o `-r' is recreate /etc/resolv.conf
		         (resolv.conf file is overwritten.)
		  o `-n' is reset HOSTNAME
