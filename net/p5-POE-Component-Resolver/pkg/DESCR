POE::Component::Resolver performs Socket::GetAddrInfo::getaddrinfo()
calls in subprocesses where they're permitted to block as long as
necessary.

By default it will run eight subprocesses and prefer address
families in whatever order Socket::GetAddrInfo returns them.
These defaults can be overridden with constructor parameters.
