ogmrip is originally a graphics package to convert dvd into ogm files.
This package only takes the subtitle extraction part.
Namely:
- sub2pgm: converts vobsub files into an srt template and a set of pgm images.
- srttool: manipulates srt templates and srt files.

Together with mplayer, which can extract vobsub, and gocr, to handle character
recognition, this allows for simple subtitle extraction.

The package contains a shell-script, subrip, that puts all the pieces 
together and can be tailored for further use.
