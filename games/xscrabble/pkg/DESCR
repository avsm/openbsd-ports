XScrabble is a multiplayer (1-4) implementation of the classic board
game Scrabble with computer players and over 118,000 word dictionary.
There is a high score table, a best single goes list, a handy setup
window, and load/save facilities.

Simply type xscrabble. This will bring up the setup box which will allow
you to enter the names and displays and other info for the game to wish
to play. Then click on the Start Game button, (or Load Previous if
you're restarting a game). The main program, xscrab, will then be
automatically called with the appropriate options.

The game is saved after every turn (in "~/.xscrabble.save" of the
person running it) and can be restarted by running xscrabble, entering
exactly the same info, and hitting the Load Previous button.
