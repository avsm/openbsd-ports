This software provides support for the Tag Image File Format (TIFF), a
widely used format for storing image data.

Included in this software distribution is a library, libtiff, for
reading and writing TIFF, a small collection of tools for doing simple
manipulations of TIFF images on UNIX systems, and documentation on the
library and tools. A small assortment of TIFF-related software for
UNIX that has been contributed by others is also included.

The library is capable of dealing with images that are written to
follow the 5.0 or 6.0 TIFF spec.  There is also considerable support
for some of the more esoteric portions of the 6.0 TIFF spec.

SGI has also added html-documentation in addition to man-pages.

NOTE: Since it is suspected that there's incompatibility between
libtiff 3.4 and previous releases, we install this kit as follows.
	/usr/local/include/tiff34.h
	/usr/local/include/tiffio34.h
	/usr/local/lib/libtiff34.a
