Several steps need to be taken to properly configure the NTP daemon.

1. First, create or update the file ${SYSCONFDIR}/ntp.conf.  Several
   example configuration files can be found here:

     ${PREFIX}/share/examples/ntp

2. Now ntp can be started with:

     /etc/rc.d/ntpd start

   Or to start 'ntpd' at every boot, add it to rc_scripts in
   /etc/rc.conf.local.
