This module enables you to make the Menu Settings required on specific
content types. It forces a node from one or more content types to be
included in the menu system before the content will be saved
successfully. This can be useful in a number of situations, e.g. when
using [menupath-raw] in the pathauto settings, which expects a node to
live within the menu system.
