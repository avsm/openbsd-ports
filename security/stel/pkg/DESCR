stel(1) is intended to be a simple and practical plug and play solution
for logging into a remote system or executing commands on a remote
system.  stel offers a variety of features which range from mutual
authentication to file transfer.  The security of stel relies upon the
underlying cryptographic design, not trusting the net in any way.  If no
options are provided, stel defaults to triple DES encryption, 1024-bits
Diffie-Hellman modulus, no protection from active attacks, and the
remote system user's shell as the command to be executed on the remote
system.  This should be reasonable for most systems, and it is believed
to be a good compromise between speed, ease of use and security.
