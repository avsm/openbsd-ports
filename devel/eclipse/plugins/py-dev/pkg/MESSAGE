This plugin works with the regular Python interpreter.

At present it does NOT work with Jython, the reason
apparently being that our Eclipse SDK is too old
(the actual problem being that the last step of
creating a Jython launch configuration explodes with a
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError on SWT TreeItem).
