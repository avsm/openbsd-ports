compiler, demos and sources for most Java runtime classes.

Executables are installed into ${PREFIX}/jdk1.1.8/bin (usually
/usr/local/jdk1.1.8/bin unless you have changed it.) You may want to
put this into your PATH or symlink them to /usr/local/bin in case you
don't have kaffe installed (which shares names with many JDK binaries.)

You may want to build a kernel with
options         SYSVSEM
