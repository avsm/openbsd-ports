FisicaLab is an educational application to solve physics problems.  The
problems are setting adding elements from the palette to chalkboard, and
writing the data of each element. The elements are objects as Blocks,
Pulleys, Mobiles, Forces, ... . Use the SI and English systems,
scientific notation and many conversion factors. The problems that can
be solved with FisicaLab, are:

* Kinematics of particles, include circular motion.
* Static of particles and rigid bodies in 2D.
* Dynamic of particles in 2D (doesn't include dynamic of circular motion)
* Heat, calorimetry, ideal gas and expansion.
