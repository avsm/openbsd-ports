xcursorgen  - create an X cursor file from a collection of PNG images

The package comes with three cursor themes : 'redglass', 'whiteglass'
and 'handhelds'. Additionally selecting the 'core' theme switches back
to the traditional X server "core" cursors. 

To use the new cursors 
- set the environment variable XCURSOR_PATH to 
  "~/.icons:${PREFIX}/lib/X11/icons"

- either :
  a) set the XCURSOR_THEME environment variable to one of the theme names 
  b) create ~/.icons/default/index.theme containing (for example to use
     the whiteglass theme):

   -- Cut --
   [Icon Theme]
   Inherits=whiteglass
   -- Cut --

The XCURSOR_SIZE environment variable can be used to set the size of
the cursors.
