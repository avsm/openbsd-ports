What is enlightenment?  It is a Window Manager that works with the 
X-Window System otherwise known as X11.

What is a Windowmanager?  Strictly speaking, a Window Manager manages
windows - it is the Window Manager's task to arrange program windows on
screen in some defined fashion, and allow the user to move, resize, 
iconify, and otherwise manipulate these client windows, without the 
client programs needing to do this themselves.

Enlightenment goes beyond this, not just Managing Windows, but providing
a useful, good looking graphical shell from which to work.  It is open 
in design, and instead of dictating a policy it allows the user to 
define their own policy right down to the minute and infinitesimal 
details; from its functionality right on through to its looks.
