The term "Memorable Random String" was thought up by Sean B. Palmer as a
name for those strings like dopynl, glargen, glonknic, spoopwiddle, and
kebble etc. that don't have any conventional sense, but can be used as
random identifiers, especially in URIs to keep them persistent. See
http://infomesh.net/2001/07/MeRS/

The String::Koremutake module converts to and from Koremutake Memorable
Random Strings.
