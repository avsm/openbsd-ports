Utility scripts for internationalizing XML.
Automatically extracts translatable strings from oaf, glade, bonobo ui,
nautilus theme and other XML files into the po files.
Automatically merges translations from po files back into .oaf files
(encoding to be 7-bit clean). The merging mechanism can also be extended
to support other types of XML files.
