# NOTES:
# Will compile with kerberos support in apfd and papd.
# Haven't tested kerberos support as there is no MacOS
# support for kerberos outside the US, so your on your
# own. Still need to add support for AFS. Will update
# the Port shortly. 1999/01/08. ianm@cit.nepean.uws.edu.au

pre-configure:
	@mkdir -p ${WRKSRC}/sys/openbsd
	@cp ${FILESDIR}/sys-OpenBSD-Makefile ${WRKSRC}/sys/openbsd/Makefile

# This may cause problems if you don't have source installed. I'm
# just lazy and didn't want to patch most of netatalk's makefiles, .c
# and .h files. There's heaps that need fixing Maybe I will in the future.
