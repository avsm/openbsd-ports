Pantomime provides a set of Objective-C classes that model a mail
system. Pantomime can be seen as a JavaMail 1.2 clone written in
Objective-C. The C language is only used where performance is critical.
Pantomime uses a little bit of ELM code.

Pantomime provides the following features (and more):
 * a full MIME encoder and decoder
 * a "folder view" to local mailboxes (Berkeley Format), POP3 accounts
   or IMAP mailboxes
 * a powerful API to work on all aspects of Message objects
 * a local mailer and a SMTP conduit for sending messages
 * APOP and SMTP AUTH support
 * IMAP and POP3 URL Scheme support
 * iconv and Core Foundation support
 * UNIX mbox and maildir support
 * SSL/TLS support for IMAP, POP3 and SMTP
