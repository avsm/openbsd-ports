c(alm)wm is a window manager for X11 initially inspired by evilwm.  It
developed out of modifications to evilwm, but eventually the code base
of evilwm did not accommodate well for the new features added.  So calmwm
was written from scratch.

cwm has several novel features, including the ability to search for
windows.  It features a very simple and attractive aesthetic.
