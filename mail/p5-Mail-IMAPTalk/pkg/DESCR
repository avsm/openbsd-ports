This module communicates with an IMAP server.  Each IMAP server command
is mapped to a method of this object.

Although other IMAP modules exist on CPAN, this has several advantages
over other modules:

* It parses the more complex IMAP structures like envelopes and body
  structures into nice Perl data structures.
* It correctly supports atoms, quoted strings and literals at any point.
  Some parsers in other modules aren't fully IMAP compatible and may
  break at odd times with certain messages on some servers.
* It allows large return values (eg. attachments on a message) to be
  read directly into a file, rather than into memory.
* It includes some helper functions to find the actual text/plain or
  text/html part of a message out of a complex MIME structure. It also can
  find a list of attachments, and CID links for HTML messages with
  attached images.
* It supports decoding of MIME headers to Perl utf-8 strings
  automatically, so you don't have to deal with MIME encoded headers
  (enabled optionally).
