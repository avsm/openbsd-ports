rzip is a compression program that is similar to gzip and bzip2.
The primary difference is that rzip is able to exploit long
distance redundancies in files, which enables rzip to produce
much better compression ratios (sometimes). However, the
drawbacks of rzip are that one cannot pipeline rzip and it is
very memory-intensive.
