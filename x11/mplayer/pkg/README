Possible issues with using MPlayer on OpenBSD:

all arches:
  The GUI is deprecated so we stripped it from the build. You can use
  x11/gnome-mplayer or x11/smplayer instead.

  Mencoder is not expected to do a good job of multiplexing into container
  formats other than AVI or MPEG.

i386:
  Win32 codecs were disabled in OpenBSD's build, as the open source codecs
  are now of decent quality.

arm:
  You may encounter slow video output.  In this case you can disable
  the X.Org screen rotation in /etc/X11/xorg.conf. Depending on the
  video you are playing you may want to pass the -framedrop or the
  -hardframedrop option to mplayer.

See the package description for a list of FLAVORs and their meaning.
