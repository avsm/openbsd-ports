The GdkPixbuf library is a replacement for Imlib.  GdkPixbuf provides 
the following: a basic data structure to provide reference-counted images, 
functions to load images synchronously from disk or progressively from 
arbitrary data buffers, and convenience functions to transform pixbufs 
and render them to drawables.
