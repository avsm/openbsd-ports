testing procedure: 
- obtain a RECENT snapshot of dejagnu from egcs.cygnus.com.
I've used dejagnu-980528 for my tests. Installation should be easy.
It was almost a drop-in for dejagnu-1.3 in my case.
Edit framework.exp to remove *.core instead of core in case of failure...
- uncomment the egcs-test... line in the Makefile.
- after build, go to work/egcs-1.1b and perform a gmake check...
you may wish to use script to record the results as you go...
Look in the work/egcs-1.1b/gcc/testsuite directory for more details.
Disregard g77 tests until g77 is ported over.

To run the same testsuites under native gcc 2.8.1:
- move the site.exp file elsewhere, edit it to get the right paths.
- remove the -Os option from the various testsuite drivers, gcc 2.8.1 
does not support -Os...
- run with e.g., GCC=/usr/bin/gcc runtest --tool gcc
