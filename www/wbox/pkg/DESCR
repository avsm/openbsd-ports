wbox aims to help you having fun while testing HTTP related stuff. You
can use it to perform many tasks, including the following.
  * Benchmarking how much time it takes to generate content for your
    web application.
  * Web server and web application stressing.
  * Testing virtual domains configuration without the need to alter
    your local resolver.
  * Check if your redirects are working correctly emitting the right
    HTTP code.
  * Test if the HTTP compression is working and if it is actually
    serving pages faster.
  * Use it as a configuration-less HTTP server to share files!
