The OpenGL Utility Toolkit, a window system independent toolkit for
writing OpenGL programs. It implements a simple windowing application
programming interface (API) for OpenGL.  GLUT is designed for
constructing small to medium sized OpenGL programs. While GLUT is
well-suited to learning OpenGL and developing simple OpenGL
applications, GLUT is not a full-featured toolkit so large applications
requiring sophisticated user interfaces are better off using native
window system toolkits like Motif.
