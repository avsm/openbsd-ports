Nepenthes can determine the malware activity on a network
by deploying a nepenthes sensor (i.e. honeypot). The programm
emulates different well known vulnerabilities waiting for
malicious connections trying to exploit them.

Packages can be built with additional FLAVORs:

  geoip: In order to provide usefull information to visualize 
the collected data, we have to resolve attacking ip 
addresses to their location. 

  mysql:  To setup a Nepenthes powerd google Map you need a 
running and working xmlrpc server with mysql database. 

  pgsql:  Dumps the Captured files to a postgresql database, 
so you can track how many hits a file gets.
