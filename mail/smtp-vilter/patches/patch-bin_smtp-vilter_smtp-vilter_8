+headers that are added downstream by the MTA.  So in order pass a message to a
+spam detection backend
+.Nm
+must generate and add its own artificial header.
+Note that this header is entirely internal and is NOT visible to the MTA or

+.Pp
+The

+parameter provides control over various features of this header.
+.Pp
+At present there is only one option, which is to indicate the sender's SASL
+authentication status as reported by the MTA:
+.Bl -tag -width "header-options=xxx"
+.It Pa header-options=0
+ignore SASL authentication status (default)
+.It Pa header-options=1
+if the sender successfully signed in then insert a tag of the form

+.Pp
+The latter behaviour emulates Postfix's "smtpd_sasl_authenticated_header"
+option. It enables a (suitably configured) spam detection backend to apply
+different rules for trusted senders.
