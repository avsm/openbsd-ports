FFTW is a C subroutine library for computing the discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) in one or more dimensions, of arbitrary input size,
and of both real and complex data (as well as of even/odd data, i.e.
the discrete cosine/sine transforms or DCT/DST).

Flavors:
	- double:	double precision library
	- float:	single precision library
