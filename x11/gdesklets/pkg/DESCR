gDesklets is a system for bringing mini programs (desklets), such as
weather forecasts, news tickers, system information displays, or music
player controls, onto your desktop, where they are sitting there in a
symbiotic relationship of eye candy and usefulness. The possibilities
are really endless and they are always there to serve you whenever you
need them, just one key-press away. The system is not restricted to
one desktop environment, but currently works on most of the modern
Unix desktops (including GNOME, KDE, Xfce).

Only a few sample desklets are included by default but many more are
available for download at ${HOMEPAGE}.
