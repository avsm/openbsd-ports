getmail is a POP3 mail retriever, with support for both ordinary and 
domain (or multidrop) POP3 mailboxes. It is written in Python, and
licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.

   * Retrieve mail from an unlimited number of POP3 mailboxes and
     servers.
   * Support for multidrop or domain mailboxes.
   * Safe and reliable delivery to qmail-style Maildirs, as well as 
     program (pipe) delivery.
   * Does not destroy information by rewriting mail headers.
   * Does not cause mail loops by doing SMTP injection, and therefore
     does not require that you run an MTA (like qmail or sendmail) on
     your host.
   * Can remember which mail it has already retrieved, and can be set
     to only download new messages.
   * Written in Python, and therefore easy to extend.
