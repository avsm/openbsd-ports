Newer ipods attempt to tie the song database to the hardware with the device
serial number. This foolish behaviour has of course been defeated. In order
for libgpod to write an appropriately keyed database, you will need your ipod's
"firewire id."

One way to get this number is using usbctl from the sysutils/usbutil port:
	usbctl -f /dev/usb0 -a 2 | grep Serial
... assuming that your ipod is at address 2 on the first usb bus.

The firewire id a 16 character long string like 00A1234567891231. For an iPod
Touch, this number will be much longer than 16 characters, the firewire ID is
constituted by the first 16 characters.

Once you have that number, create/edit /mnt/iPod_Control/Device/SysInfo (if
your iPod is mounted at /mnt/), and add following line:
FirewireGuid: 0xffffffffffffffff
where ffffffffffffffff your ipod's id number. The "0x" prefix is required.

Gtkpod should now be able to write a valid database to your ipod.

(Based heavily on the libgpod "README.SysInfo" file)
