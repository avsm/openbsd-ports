MPlayer is a media player.  It plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI, VIVO, ASF/WMV,
QT/MOV, FLI, NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM, RoQ, and some RealMedia files,
supported by many native, XAnim, and Win32 DLL codecs.  You can watch
VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, FLI, and even DivX movies too.

MPlayer supports a wide range of video output drivers.  It works with
X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL and optionally AAlib or SDL (and this way all
drivers of SDL).  Most of them support software or hardware scaling,
so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen.
