Doc is an initial implementation of an automated domain testing tool.
We expect considerable design modification and implementation changes
to be made as experience is gained through use in the Internet.  At
some point, we expect the design to stabilize and a production
version, implemented in something other than the current UNIX-tool
patchwork, to be released.
