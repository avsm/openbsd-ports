Xautolock monitors the user activity on an X  Window  dis-
play.  If  none is detected within mins minutes, a program
is started as specified by the -locker  option.  Xautolock
will  typically be used to lock the screen (hence its pri-
mary name) but it really doesn't  care  what  program  you
make  it start. For this reason, xautolock does not inter-
fere with the default X screen saver, unless  the  -reset-
saver  option is used.  This implies that it is the job of
the locker or the user to take the appropriate actions  if
the default screen saver is to be disabled.  The only real
assumption made by  xautolock  is  that  a  new  countdown
starts as soon as the locker exits.
