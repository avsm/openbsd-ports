SQLite database of every port in the system. This can be queried through
e.g., sqlitebrowser, or any kind of programming interface.

This schema is mostly optimized for tools, and cumbersome to query by
hand.

Database Schema:
- Paths (ID, FULLPKGPATH, PKGPATH)
PKGPATH points to a PATHS entry corresponding to the stripped down version of 
FULLPKGPATH, without flavors or subpackage markers, or is null if FULLPKGPATH
is already stripped.  Every other FULLPKGPATH, PKGPATH, DEPENDSPATH entry
in the database points to this table.

- Ports(FULLPKGPATH, ...)
holds all the information retrieved through various variables that is not
stored in specialized tables, e.g.,:
    AUTOCONF_VERSION 
    AUTOMAKE_VERSION 
    BROKEN 
    COMMENT 
    DESCR 
    DISTFILES 
    DISTNAME 
    DIST_SUBDIR 
    FLAVORS 
    HOMEPAGE 
    IS_INTERACTIVE 
    MAINTAINER
    MULTI_PACKAGES 
    NO_*
    PERMIT_*
    PKGNAME 
    PKG_ARCH 
    PSEUDO_FLAVORS 
    REGRESS_IS_INTERACTIVE 
    SEPARATE_BUILD 
    SHARED_ONLY 
    SUBPACKAGE 
    SUPDISTFILES 
    USE_*

This information is mostly unchanged, except for replacing Yes/No variables
with 1/0. Variables not present in a given port are left undefined.

MULTI_PACKAGES ports hold several entries with corresponding FULLPKGPATH

- Flavors(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
- PseudoFlavors(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
- Categories(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
- Multi(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)		('-' values are not stored)
- Modules(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
- Configure(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE) 	(corresponds to CONFIGURE_STYLE)
- ConfigureArgs(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
- MasterSites(FULLPKGPATH, N, VALUE)
- NotForArch(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
- OnlyForArch(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE)
All of these variable values are actually lists. These lists are taken apart
and result in many entries in these secondary tables (or none if the list
is completely empty)


Each keyword table follows the same scheme
TABLENAME(KEYREF, VALUE)


- Depends(FULLPKGPATH, FULLDEPENDS, PKGSPEC, REST, DEPENDSPATH, TYPE)
All depends are stored in a single table, including the type:
0 -> library
1 -> run
2 -> build
3 -> regress
with FULLDEPENDS the full text of the dependency, and DEPENDSPATH the key to
the FULLPKGPATH we depend upon.
- Wantlib(FULLPKGPATH, VALUE, EXTRA)
All the libraries the FULLPKGPATH depends upon, with optional version 
number specification stored in EXTRA
coming from either the WANTLIB variable or various LIB_DEPENDS.

- Broken(FULLPKGPATH, ARCH, TEXT)
This is stored both in the main table (for now) and in a separate table, with
keywords since it may be arch-dependent

- Shared_Libs(FULLPKGPATH, LIBNAME, VERSION)

Some information, both in the main table and in secondary tables 
is stored as keyword references to other tables:
AUTOCONF_VERSION, AUTOMAKE_VERSION -> AUTOVERSION
MAINTAINER -> EMAIL
CATEGORIES -> CATEGORYKEYS
CONFIGURE -> CONFIGURE_KEYS
MODULES -> MODULEKEYS
WANTLIB.VALUE, SHARED_LIBS.LIBNAME -> LIBRARY
PERMIT_*, SEPARATE_BUILD -> KEYWORDS2
FLAVORS, PSEUDO_FLAVORS -> KEYWORDS
NOT_FOR_ARCHS, ONLY_FOR_ARCHS, PKG_ARCH -> ARCH
