SIP is a tool for automatically generating Python bindings for C and C++
libraries.
SIP comprises a code generator and a Python module.  The code generator
processes a set of specification files and generates C or C++ code which
is then compiled to create the bindings extension module.  The SIP
Python module provides support functions to the automatically generated
code.
