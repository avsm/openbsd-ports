 Hide the bar, when 'mod4' is not pressed. With this, dockmode will not be set, and the bar is out of the way most of the time so you have more room.

 == DESCRIPTION
 
-*i3bar* is an xcb- and libev-based status- and ws-bar. It is best thought of as an replacement for the *i3-wsbar*(1) + *dzen2*(1)-combination. It creates a workspace-bar for every active output ("screen") and displays a piped in statusline rightaligned on every bar.
+*i3bar* is an xcb- and libev-based status- and ws-bar. It is best thought of as a replacement for the *i3-wsbar*(1) + *dzen2*(1)-combination. It creates a workspace-bar for every active output ("screen") and displays a piped in statusline rightaligned on every bar.
 
 It does not sample any status-information itself, so you still need a program like *i3status*(1) or *conky*(1) for that.
 
-i3bar does not support any color or other markups, so stdin should be plain utf8, one line at a time. If you use *i3status*(1), you therefore should specify 'output_format = none' in the general-section of it's configfile.

 Also, you should disable the internal workspace bar of *i3*(1), when using *i3bar* by specifying 'workspace_bar no' in your *i3*-configfile.
