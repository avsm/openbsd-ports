This software changes the resolution of an available vbios mode.
It is reported to work on several i855 / i865 / i915 chipset based
laptops. This is needed on certain laptops in order to get the full
native resolution of the LCD.

It patches only the RAM version of the video bios so the new resolution
is lost each time you reboot.

As 855resolution needs write access to /dev/mem, it does only work
in securelevel 0 or below.
