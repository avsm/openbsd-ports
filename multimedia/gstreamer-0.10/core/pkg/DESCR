GStreamer is a streaming-media framework, based on graphs of filters which
operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do anything
from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just about anything
else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means that new data
types or processing capabilities can be added simply by installing new 
plugins.
