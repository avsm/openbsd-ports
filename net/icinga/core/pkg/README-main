Running ICINGA on OpenBSD
=========================

Getting Started
---------------

The main documentation for Icinga is provided in HTML format as part of
the icinga-cgi package, see /var/www/icinga-cgi/docs/en/index.html

The included sample configuration carries out some simple checks
on the local machine; these should work as-is.

You may check your configuration file format before starting Icinga:

	/usr/local/bin/icinga -v ${SYSCONFDIR}/icinga/icinga.cfg

This will parse all configuration files and warn about any problems
which have been identified.

Chroot Considerations
---------------------

If using OpenBSD's default chroot environment for httpd, some files
will need to be moved inside the jail and symbolic links created:

	mkdir -p /var/www/etc /var/www/var/log
	mv ${SYSCONFDIR}/icinga /var/www/etc/
	ln -s /var/www/etc/icinga ${SYSCONFDIR}
	mv /var/icinga /var/www/var/
	ln -s /var/www/var/icinga /var
	mv /var/log/icinga /var/www/var/log/
	ln -s /var/www/var/log/icinga /var/log

Web User-Interfaces
-------------------

Two web-based user interfaces are available for Icinga:

- icinga-cga: the classic (but improved) Nagios-style interface
- icinga-web: new API-based interface

At the time of writing, porting and packaging of icinga-web is
a work-in-progress.  To enable icinga-cgi, link the provided httpd.conf
snippet:

	ln -s ../modules.sample/icinga-cgi.conf /var/www/conf/modules

You may wish to modify this file.  By default it uses HTTP basic
authentication; you can create the password file as follows:

	touch ${SYSCONFDIR}/icinga/htpasswd.users
	htpasswd ${SYSCONFDIR}/icinga/htpasswd.users <username>

When done, restart the web server:

	apachectl stop
	apachectl start

You should then be able to access the web interface at
http://localhost/icinga/

Moving from Nagios
------------------

The configuration format is compatible with Nagios.  If you'd like
to move across with minimal changes, you can point Icinga at your
existing configuration files:

	echo 'icinga_flags="-d ${SYSCONFDIR}/nagios/nagios.cfg"' >> /etc/rc.conf.local
	echo 'rc_scripts="${rc_scripts} icinga' >> /etc/rc.conf.local

You will need to merge the settings between Nagios' and Icinga's
cgi.cfg files.  sdiff(1), as used by sysmerge(8), can help with this.
main_config_file and some other settings (admin usernames etc) should
be taken from the Nagios file, whereas the various web-related settings
(url_html_path, physical_html_path, etc) need to point to the Icinga files.
