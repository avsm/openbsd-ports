+---------------
| wxWidgets normally installs a symlink from wx-config to the config
| script which is specific to the GUI library.
|
| OpenBSD supports installing multiple GUI libraries side-by-side, so you
| must either call the script directly (eg wxgtk-2.4-config), or set an
| environment variable WXCONFIG before calling wx-config.
