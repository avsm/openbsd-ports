To completely deinstall webacula you need to perform the following steps
as root:
    # rm -f /var/www/conf/modules/webacula.conf
    # ${INSTDIR}/webacula-chroot-bconsole disable

*** WARNING ***
/var/www/bin/sh, /var/www/usr/libexec/ld.so and files under
/var/www/lib/ may be shared by other executable(s) in the chroot(8), so
when running 'webacula-chroot-bconsole disable', make sure nothing else
uses these files or you will need to reinstall them manually
