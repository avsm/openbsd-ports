JVim is a text editor that is upwards compatible to vi. It can be used
to edit any ASCII and Japanese(EUC or JIS) text.  It is especially
useful for editing programs.

There are a lot of enhancements above vi: multi level undo, command
line editing, filename completion, on line help, quoting, etc.. Read
difference.doc for a summary of the differences between vi and Vim.
