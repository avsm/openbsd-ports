$OpenBSD: SECURITY,v 1.3 2005/05/31 09:09:30 db Exp $
Release 2.4.0 addressed a number of security concerns with the assistance
of Theo de Raadt, Ejovi Nuwere and David Sacerdote of the OpenBSD project.

The backup data is transmitted across the network unencrypted unless you
use kencrypt, IPsec or the gpg flavor.

Kerberos support was present in 2.4.0, but was broken in later releases.
The 2.4.4p2 release addressed some of the problems. The current status of
Kerberos support for this version is unknown.
