CGI::XMLApplication is a CGI application class, that intends to
enable perl artists to implement CGIs that make use of XML/XSLT
functionality, without taking too much care about specialized
errorchecking. Also it is ment to provide the power of the XML::LibXML
/ XML::LibXSLT module package. CGI::XMLApplication's serialization
process pays a lot attention of keeping an application stable to
run. So a programmer has not to bother about some of XML::LibXML/
XML::LibXSLT serialization pitfalls.
