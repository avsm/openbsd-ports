The morseplayer utility reads from its standard input and plays
corresponding morse code sounds from an audio device.  The program has
the full character set for the ARRL/FCC Element 2 examination, and
generates the timing of  `dits',  `dahs', intra-element spacing,
character spacing, and word spacing as specified by the ARRL.
