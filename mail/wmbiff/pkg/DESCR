WMbiff displays the status of up to five mailboxes. It gives information
about new mail, if any, or total number of messages. It also has mail retrieval
capabilies, and can be configured to do this automatically. At the moment,
UNIX-style, POP3 and IMAP4 mailboxes are supported. WMbiff also supports Licq
history files, displaying the number of new messages in your running Licq
session, as if they were mail.
