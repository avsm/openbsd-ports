GNU Zile is a lightweight Emacs clone. Zile is short for Zile Is
Lossy Emacs.  Zile has been written to be as similar as possible
to Emacs; every Emacs user should feel at home.

Zile has all of Emacs's basic editing features: it is 8-bit clean
(though it currently lacks Unicode support), and the number of
editing buffers and windows is only limited by available memory and
screen space respectively.  Registers, minibuffer completion and
auto fill are available.  Function and variable names are identical
with Emacs's (except those containing the word "emacs", which instead
contain the word "zile"!).
