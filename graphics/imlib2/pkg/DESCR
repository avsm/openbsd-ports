Imlib2, which is the successor to Imlib, is an image manipulation
library.  It is not a newer version, it is a completely new library.
Imlib2 can be installed alongside Imlib1.x without any problems since
they are effectively different libraries, they do have very similar
functionality however.  Imlib2 does all of its tasks faster than other
libraries due to smart subsystems and a high degree of code
optimizations.
