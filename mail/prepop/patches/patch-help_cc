-Description:
-prepop is a simple \"online\" POP3 email client, very suitable for dialups and
-other slow connections. It lets you read the text/plain part of your email
-messages without having to download those big pesky attachments (over dialups
-this can sometimes take a long time and during this time you often have no idea
-on how much data is left to be transferred). With prepop you can also see the
-size of all the messages when listing them. You can't reply to messages since
-this was not what prepop was designed to do. prepop was not designed to be an
-alternative to your current email client. It's more of a complementing email
-client doing some of the things your ordinary email client should have handled
-in the first place.
