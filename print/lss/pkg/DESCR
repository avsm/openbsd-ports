LSS is a symbol browser to help creating LaTeX documents with many math
symbols.

All symbols are grouped into categories and user can copy symbol name to
system-wide clipboard (or insert it directly to first running copy of
gVIM) by selecting symbol icon from list. Many non-standard (and
unsupported in LSS) symbols can be found in the comprehensive LATEX
symbol list.
