Cogl is a modern 3D graphics API with associated utility APIs designed
to expose the features of 3D graphics hardware using a direct state
access API design, as opposed to the state-machine style of OpenGL. It
is implemented in the C programming language but we want to provide
bindings for everyone's favorite language too.
