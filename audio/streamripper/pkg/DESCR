Streamripper started as a way to separate tracks via Shoutcast's
title-streaming feature. This has now been expanded into a much more
generic feature, where part of the program only tries to "hint" at
where one track starts and another ends, thus allowing a MP3 decoding
engine to scan for a silent mark, which is used to find an exact track
separation.
