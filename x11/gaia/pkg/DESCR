Gaia is an open 3D earth viewer (formerly an attempt to reverse engineer
famous Google Earth).
It features a GPS layer which is capable of displaying route and current
location for any NMEA-speaking device.  Also works as gpsd client,
allowing you to work with almost any GPS device either locally or via
network.
