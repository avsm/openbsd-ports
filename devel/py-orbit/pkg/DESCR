This is a Python language binding for the ORBit2 CORBA implementation.
It aims to take advantage of new features found in ORBit2 to make
language bindings more efficient. 
This includes:
 - use of ORBit2 type libraries to generate stubs
 - use of the ORBit_small_invoke_stub() call for operation invocation,
   which allows for short circuited invocation on local objects
Currently only the client side of the binding has been done.
