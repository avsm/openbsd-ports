Mirfak is an open-source mod_frontpage reimplementation that is more
secure, and can be used with a binary installation of Apache (possibly
including mod_ssl, php, etc).

This module replaces the Apache-FP patches and module supplied with the
Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions available from Microsoft and
Ready-to-Run Software.
