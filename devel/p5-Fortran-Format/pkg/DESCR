This is a Perl implementation of the Fortran 77 formatted input/output
facility. One possible use is for producing input files for old Fortran
programs, making sure that their column-oriented records are rigorously
correct. Fortran formats may also have some advantages over C<printf> in
some cases: it is very easy to output an array, reusing the format as
needed; and the syntax for repeated columns is more concise. Unlike
C<printf>, for good or ill, Fortran-formatted fields never exceed their
desired width.
