	    Pretty Good Privacy version 2.6.3ia (world wide use)

PGP 2.6.3ia is not an official PGP version. It is based on the source
code for MIT PGP 2.6.2 and has been modified for world wide use. PGP
2.6.3i (international) is legal in the United States after September
6, 2000 (when RSA Security, Inc. placed its public key encryption
algorithm in the public domain).

For a more thorough installation and usage guide, refer to the file
setup.doc and the documentation for PGP 2.6.2, which is included
unmodified in the doc/ subdirectory that is created when you unpack the
distribution archive and installed in /usr/local/share/doc.
