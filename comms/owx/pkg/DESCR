OWX (Open Wouxun) is an open-source program designed to program Wouxun
transceivers. It was developed on Wouxun KG-UV2D and tested on KG-UVD1P
(both identify as KG669V). Possibly other Wouxuns are supported too, but
this is not guaranteed - use at your own risk and ALWAYS make backups!
This software is highly experimental. Using it can result in rendering
your radio unusable and your dog killed. You have been warned.
