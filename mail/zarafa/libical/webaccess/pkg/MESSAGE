Zarafa webaccess has been installed under
${INSTDIR}

Whether you want to provide access to regular and/or mobile clients, you
should point the followings to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
   # ln -s ../zarafa/webaccess /var/www/htdocs/webaccess
   # ln -s ../zarafa/webaccess-mobile /var/www/htdocs/webaccess-mobile
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

You need to edit the config.php file installed under:
${INSTDIR}/webaccess for regular web client access
${INSTDIR}/webaccess-mobile for mobile client access

You may want to edit ${PREFIX}/conf/php.ini according to
   ${INSTDIR}/webaccess/.htaccess
In any case, short_open_tag must be "On".

If you want to debug the webaccess, copy the following file
   ${INSTDIR}/webaccess{-mobile}/debug.php.disabled
to
   ${INSTDIR}/webaccess{-mobile}/debug.php
The debugging output will then be available under:
   ${INSTDIR}/webaccess{-mobile}/debug.txt
