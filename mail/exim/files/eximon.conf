#                The Exim Monitor                #
##################################################

# This is the template for the Exim monitor's main build-time configuration
# file. It contains settings that are independent of any operating system. It
# should be edited and then saved to a file called Local/eximon.conf before
# running the make command to build the monitor, if any settings are required.
# Local/eximon.conf can be empty if no changes are needed. The examples given
# here (commented out) are the default settings.

# Any settings made in the configuration file can be overridden at run time
# by setting up an environment variable with the same name as any of these
# options, but preceded by EXIMON_, for example, EXIMON_WINDOW_TITLE.

# The qualifying name for your domain. The only use made of this is for
# testing that certain addresses are the same when displaying the
# log tail, and for shortening sender addresses in the queue display.

# QUALIFY_DOMAIN=

# The default minimum width and height for the whole window are 103 and
# 162 pixels respectively. This is enough to hold the left-most stripchart
# and the quit button. The values can be changed here.

# MIN_HEIGHT=162
# MIN_WIDTH=103

# The title for eximon's main display window. It is possible to have
# host name of the machine you are running on substituted into the
# title string. If you include the string ${fullhostname} then the
# complete name is used. If you include ${hostname} then the full
# host name will have the string contained in the DOMAIN variable
# stripped from its right-hand end before being substituted. Any other
# shell or environment variables may also be included.

# If you use any substitutions, remember to ensure that the $ and {}
# characters are escaped from the shell, e.g. by using single quotes.

# WINDOW_TITLE='${hostname} eximon'

# The domain that you want to be stripped from the machine's full hostname
# when forming the short host name for the eximon window title, as
# described above.

# DOMAIN=

# Parameters for the rolling display of the tail of the exim log file.
# The width and depth are measured in pixels; LOG_BUFFER specifies the
# amount of store to set aside for holding the log tail, which is displayed
# in a scrolling window. When this store is full, the earlier 50% of it
# is discarded - this is much more efficient that throwing it away line
# by line. The number given can be followed by the letter K to indicate
# that the value is in kilobytes. A minimum value of 1K is enforced.

# LOG_DEPTH=300
# LOG_WIDTH=950
# LOG_BUFFER=20K

# The font which is used in the log tail display. This is defined in
# the normal X manner. It must be a "character cell" font, because this
# is required by the text widget.

# LOG_FONT=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-14-140-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1

# Parameters for the display of message that are on the exim queue.
# The width and depth are measured in pixels.

# QUEUE_DEPTH=200
# QUEUE_WIDTH=950

# The font which is used in the queue display.

# QUEUE_FONT=$LOG_FONT

# When a message has more than one undelivered address, they are listed
# one below the other. A limit can be placed on the number of addresses
# displayed for any one message. If there are more, then "..." is used
# to indicate this.

# QUEUE_MAX_ADDRESSES=10

# The display of the contents of the queue is updated every QUEUE_INTERVAL
# seconds by default (there is a button to request update).

# QUEUE_INTERVAL=300

# The size of the popup text window that is used for looking at the
# contents of messages, etc.

# TEXT_DEPTH=200

# The keystroke/mouse-operation that is used to pop up the menu in the
# queue window is configurable. The default is Shift with the lefthand
# mouse button. The name of an alternative can be specified in the standard
# X way of naming these things. With the default configuration for the monitor,
# individuals can override this by setting the EXIMON_MENU_EVENT environment
# variable.

# MENU_EVENT=Shift<Btn1Down>

# When the menu is used to perform an operation on a message, the output
# from the exim command that is generated is displayed in a separate window
# by default. Set this option to "no" if you don't want to see the output -
# the result of the operation is normally visible in the log window in any
# case. This does not apply to the output generated from attempting to
# deliver a message. That is always shown.

# ACTION_OUTPUT=yes

# When some action is taken on a message, such as freezing it, or changing
# its recipients, the queue display is normally automatically updated. On
# systems that have very large queues, this can take some time and be dis-
# tracting. If this option is set to "no", the queue display is no longer
# automatically updated after an action is applied to a message.

# ACTION_QUEUE_UPDATE=yes

# When the menu item to display a message's body is invoked, the amount
# of data is limited to BODY_MAX bytes. This limit is a safety precaution
# to save the screen scrolling for ever on an enormous message.

# BODY_MAX=20000

# The stripcharts are updated every STRIPCHART_INTERVAL seconds.

# STRIPCHART_INTERVAL=60

# The following variable contains a specification of which stripcharts
# you want eximon to display based on log entries. The string consists of
# pairs of strings, delimited by slash characters. The first string in each
# pair is a regular expression that matches some distinguishing feature in a
# exim log entry.

# Entries that match the expression will be counted and displayed in a
# stripchart whose title is given by the second string. The string may
# be continued over several input lines, provided that it is split
# after a slash, and an additional slash (optionally preceded by white
# space) is included at the start of the continuation line.

# The regular expression syntax supported by eximon is as follows:

# A regular expression is zero or more branches, separated by `|'. It
# matches anything that matches one of the branches. A branch is zero or
# more pieces, concatenated. It matches a match for the first, followed by
# a match for the second, etc. A piece is an atom possibly followed by
# `*', `+', or `?'.
#
# An atom followed by `*' matches a sequence of 0 or more matches of the atom.
# An atom followed by `+' matches a sequence of 1 or more matches of the atom.
# An atom followed by `?' matches a match of the atom, or the null string.
#
# An atom is a regular expression in parentheses (matching a match for the
# regular expression), a range (see below), `.' (matching any single
# character), `^' (matching the null string at the beginning of the input
# string), `$' (matching the null string at the end of the input string),
# a `\' followed by a single character (matching that character), or a
# single character with no other significance (matching that character).
#
# A range is a sequence of characters enclosed in `[]'. It normally
# matches any single character from the sequence. If the sequence begins
# with `^', it matches any single character not from the rest of the
# sequence. If two characters in the sequence are separated by `-', this
# is shorthand for the full list of ASCII characters between them (e.g.
# `[0-9]' matches any decimal digit). To include a literal `]' in the
# sequence, make it the first character (following a possible `^'). To
# include a literal `-', make it the first or last character.

# A stripchart showing the count of messages in the queue is always
# displayed on the left of eximon's window. Stripcharts configured
# by this parameter are displayed to its right, in the order defined
# here.

# LOG_STRIPCHARTS='/ <= /in/
#                  / => /out/
#                  / => .+ D=/local/
#                  / => .+ T=[^ ]*smtp/smtp/'

# The following variable may be set to the name of a disc partition. If
# it is, a stripchart showing the percentage fullness of the partition
# will be displayed as the second stripchart. This can be used to keep
# a display of a mail spool partition on the screen.

# SIZE_STRIPCHART=/var/mail
