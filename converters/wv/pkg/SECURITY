This package has some pretty dodgy temp-file creation routines.
Some of them have been patched away by wrapping them around mktemp(1)
calls, but some remain.  Set the TMPDIR environment variable to a
unique directory to avoid this problem.

The maintainer says that they are rewriting this package completely to
avoid these problems in the future.
