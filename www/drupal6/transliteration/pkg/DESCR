Provides a central transliteration service to other Drupal modules, and
sanitizes file names while uploading. Generally spoken, it takes Unicode
text and tries to represent it in US-ASCII characters (universally
displayable, unaccented characters) by attempting to transliterate the
pronunciation expressed by the text in some other writing system to
Roman letters.
