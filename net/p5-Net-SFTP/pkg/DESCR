Net::SFTP is a pure-Perl implementation of the Secure File
Transfer Protocol (SFTP)--file transfer built on top of the
SSH protocol. Net::SFTP uses Net::SSH::Perl to build a
secure, encrypted tunnel through which files can be transferred
and managed. It provides a subset of the commands listed in
the SSH File Transfer Protocol IETF draft.
