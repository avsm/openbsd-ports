multitail allows the viewing of one or multiple files like
the original tail(1) program. 
The difference is that this program creates multiple windows
windows on the console (with ncurses). It can also use colors
while displaying the logfiles for faster recognizing which
lines are important and which are not. It is optimized for
terminal-sessions through slow links.
