The Mail::Box module is a modern mail-folder manager.

The modules are trying to keep messages stored in the mailbox file(s)
for as long as possible.  Only if the user of a folder really needs
the content of a message, that message is read from file and parsed.

Demand- or delayed-parsing of messages is implemented using the
standard AUTOLOAD mechanism, which means that it is not visible to
the user of the folder!  This mechanism also reduces the memory
foot-print of the program enormously.
