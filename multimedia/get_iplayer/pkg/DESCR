get_iplayer has PVR-like capabilities (like Sky+ / TiVo / Series-Link);
you can save lists of programme searches which are automatically
recorded when they become available so that you can watch them when
you choose and on devices that cannot run Adobe Flash Player - even
if you don't have adequate broadband speeds or if your broadband
streams too slowly at peak hours when you want to watch a programme.
