Mscgen is a small program that parses Message Sequence Chart
descriptions and produces PNG, SVG, EPS or server side image maps
(ismaps) as the output. Message Sequence Charts (MSCs) are a way of
representing entities and interactions over some time period and are
often used in combination with SDL. MSCs are popular in Telecoms to
specify how protocols operate although MSCs need not be complicated to
create or use. Mscgen aims to provide a simple text language that is
clear to create, edit and understand, which can also be transformed into
common image formats for display or printing.
