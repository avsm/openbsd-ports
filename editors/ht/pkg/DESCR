HT is a file editor/viewer/analyzer for executables. 
The goal is to combine the low-level functionality of a debugger 
and the usability of IDEs. 

- Supported formats
Support means that HT will be able to correctly display and modify 
the executable header, image and other extensions specific to the 
file (import/export sections, relocations, debugging information 
etc.). 
Support includes the following file formats: 

* Win32 portable executables (PE) (good support) 
* Unix executable and linkable format (ELF) (good support) 
* DOS standard executables (MZ) (supported) 
* Win32 linear executables (LE) (supported) 
* Windows/OS2 "new" executables (NE) (supported) 
* Unix common object file format (COFF) + DJGPP COFF (supported) 
* OS2 linear executables (LX) 
* M$ object files (.obj) 

Suports 'copy', 'paste', histories, as well as 'undo'.
