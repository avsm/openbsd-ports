Method modifiers are a powerful feature from the CLOS (Common Lisp
Object System) world.
Class::Method::Modifiers provides three modifiers: before, around, and
after.  before and after are run just before and after the method they
modify, but can not really affect that original method.  around is run
in place of the original method, with a hook to easily call that
original method.
