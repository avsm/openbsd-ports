If midori complains about missing icons, install a freedesktop.org
compliant icon-theme (like gnome-icon-theme or tango-icon-theme) and
set it as default through a ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file containing :

gtk-icon-theme-name = "<theme name>"

If https page fails to open, you may have to set
WEBKIT_IGNORE_SSL_ERRORS=1 in your environment before launching midori.
(see https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19146)
