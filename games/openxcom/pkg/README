| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to play the game you need original data from
"UFO: Enemy Unknown" / "X-Com: UFO Defense".
For a system wide installation you can copy them to:
    ${PREFIX}/share/openxcom/DATA/

You can also make a user specific installation like this:
    $ mkdir ~/ufoxcom
    $ cp -r ${PREFIX}/share/openxcom ~/ufoxcom

Now you need to put the original data under ~/ufoxcom/DATA and to run
the game, execute 'openxcom-bin' under ~/ufoxcom.
