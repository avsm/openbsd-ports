gtk-vnc provides a core library written in C, using coroutines to allow
it to be completely asynchronous while remaining single threaded. A
wrapper library using PyGTK provides access to the widget functionality
from Python. Two example programs illustrate use of the widget by
re-implementing the traditional 'vncviewer' in a few 10's of lines of
code.
