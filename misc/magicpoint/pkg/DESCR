	     MagicPoint - an X11 based presentation tool

MagicPoint is an X11 based presentation tool.  It is designed to make
simple presentations easy while to make complicated presentations
possible.  Its presentation file (whose suffix is typically .mgp) is
just text so that you can create presentation files quickly with your
favorite editor (e.g. Emacs).

For more information, see /usr/X11R6/share/doc/mgp/*.
Sample files are located in /usr/X11R6/share/doc/mgp/sample.
It's a good idea to preview a sample file before installation.
