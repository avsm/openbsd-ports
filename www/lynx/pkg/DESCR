lynx is a program which allows a user to access World-Wide Web servers
and other information servers.  It uses only ascii representation so
that it can be used from ascii-terminals and dialin-lines.

lynx(1) was added to OpenBSD release 2.3.  Therefore, it can be used
without installing this port.  However, to maintain backward compatibility
with those who may have hard coded the path to lynx, the port can be'
installed.  The installation will create a symbolic link to the released
version of lynx.  A pkg_delete of this port will remove the link.
