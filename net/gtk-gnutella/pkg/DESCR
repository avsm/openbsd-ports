What is Gtk-Gnutella ?

Gtk-Gnutella is a clone of Gnutella (see gnutella.wego.com).  It's
a Unix clone, and it needs GTK+ (1.2 or above). Gnome is not needed.
It is currently developed and tested under Linux (Redhat 6).  It
is known to run at least on Linux and FreeBSD (on 80x86 machines).
It is released under the GNU Public License (GPL).

Is it finished ?

No. Currently it lacks all sharing support, as well as many other
(minor) features. But you should already be able to search for any
files you want and to download them.
