To finish the install of XCache, you need to enable
the module by using the following command

    # ${LOCALBASE}/sbin/phpxs -a xcache

If you already have Apache running on your machine,
you should not use "apachectl restart" - instead,
you should fully stop and then restart the server.

You'll also need to configure XCache using various 
settings in php.ini.  See ${PREFIX}/xcache/INSTALL
for details.
