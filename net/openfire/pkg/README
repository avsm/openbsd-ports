Using openfire in an OpenBSD environment
========================================

1) openfire requires a database.  If you intend on using the embedded
   (HSQLDB) database you may skip to step #2.  If you intend on using
   MySQL or PostgreSQL, instructions are available at:

    ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/doc/openfire/database.html

2) openfire may be started by executing:

   ${SYSCONFDIR}/rc.d/openfire start

   as root. To arrange for this to happen at boot, include 'openfire'
   in the rc_scripts variable in ${SYSCONFDIR}/rc.d/rc.conf/local

3) After starting openfire, you may access the web interface at
   http://[hostname]:9090/; when you first login there is a configuration
   dialog. After enabling SSL, you can use https://[hostname]:9091/

4) openfire's automated setup and plugin installation services require
   several directories to be writable by the _openfire user.  When you
   complete the installation process, you may wish to tighten permissions
   on ${TRUEPREFIX}/openfire and its subdirectories.

5) openfire's DIGEST-MD5 SASL mechanism does not interoperate very well.
   If you experience issues with client authentication, you may need to
   force the SASL mechanism to PLAIN by adding:

   <sasl><mechs>PLAIN</mechs></sasl>

   as the second-last line of ${TRUEPREFIX}/openfire/conf/openfire.xml
   (e.g, just inside the closing XML tag).

   Then restart openfire for the changes to take effect.
