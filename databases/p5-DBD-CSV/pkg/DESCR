The DBD::CSV module is yet another driver for the DBI (Database
independent interface for Perl). This one is based on the SQL
"engine" SQL::Statement and the abstract DBI driver DBD::File and
implements access to so-called CSV files (Comma separated values).
Such files are mostly used for exporting MS Access and MS Excel
data.
