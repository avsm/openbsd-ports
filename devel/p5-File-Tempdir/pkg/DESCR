This module provide an object interface to tempdir() from File::Temp.
This allows to destroy the temporary directory as soon you don't need it
anymore using the magic DESTROY() function automatically call be perl
when the object is no longer reference.

If a value is passed to at object creation, it become only a container
allowing to keep same code in your function.
