Agglomerated SSL was written in order to hide the awful OpenSSL API. It
strives to reuse the OpenSSL APIs and provide a much simpler and sane
interface for programmers that are interested in writing applications
that require the SSL/TLS protocol for secure communications.

All code is written under the ISC license. The code currently is under
heavy development.
