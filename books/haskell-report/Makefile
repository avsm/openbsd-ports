COMMENT=		language and library specification for Haskell

# Strictly speaking, there's no version at all, just the report of the
# programming language "Haskell 98". I don't care for now that there may
# be future errata, since the next major language specification is on
# the way (hopefully with a more conservative naming scheme, i.e.
# something like Haskell 2.0) and will be released very soon now[tm].
