LifeLines is a free and open source genealogy program to help with
your family history research. It has native versions for Unix-like,
Mac, and Windows operating systems.

The format of the data as presented to the user for viewing, data
entry, and updating follows the GEDCOM format.

The real power of LifeLines is its scripting ability. There are a
number of LifeLines reports (aka scripts) that generate all manner
of output -- ahnentafels, ancestor/descendent reports, formatted
ancestor reports, beautiful books of all ancestors, fan charts of
ancestors, vital records of all individuals in a format suitable
for importing to palm pilot databases (specifically DB which is
also hosted here on SourceForge). All the reports are included in
the kit.

Several reports can do error and sanity checking of data; such as
deaths before births, extreme May-December marriages, etc.
