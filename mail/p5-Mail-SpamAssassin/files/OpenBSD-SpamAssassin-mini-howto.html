<p><b>Usage:</b><br>

You can use spamassassin in many ways. But the lightest for the machine is by
making use of the spamc/spamd combination.

<p>Add this line to <b><code>/etc/rc.local</b></code>:
<pre><b># @PREFIX@/bin/spamd -u _spamdaemon -d</b></pre>
<br> Use that same line to start spamd now.

<p>The final step: put this at the top of your <b><code>.procmailrc</b></code>.
If you do not want to use procmail please check the

<p><b>Customizing:</b><br>

The spam filtering is not perfect. But since the feedback is very extensive you
should be able to do what is necessary to get most spam filtered. 

<p>If you want to add custom settings to spamassassin you can create the 
file<code><b> @SYSCONFDIR@/mail/spamassassin/local.cf </b></code>. All possible options are 
described in:<code><b> man Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf</b></code>
