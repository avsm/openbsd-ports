checkpassword provides a simple, uniform password-checking interface
to all root applications. It is suitable for use by applications
such as login, ftpd, and pop3d.

There are checkpassword-compatible tools that support alternate
password databases, secret login names, long passwords, subaccounts,
one-time passwords, detailed accounting, and many other features.
Applications that use the checkpassword interface will work with
all of these tools.  Several tools have been specifically designed
to support POP toasters.
