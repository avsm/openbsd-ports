rake-compiler aims to help Gem developers deal with Ruby extensions,
simplifying code and reducing duplication.

It follows convention over configuration and sets a standardized
structure to build and package both C and Java extensions in your gems.

This is the result of experiences dealing with several Gems that
required native extensions across platforms and different user
configurations where details like portability and clarity of code were
lacking.
