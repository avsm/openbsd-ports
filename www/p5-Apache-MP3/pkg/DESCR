Apache::MP3 version 2.x

This module takes a hierarchy of directories containing MP3 files and
presents it as a browsable song library for streaming over the web.
It requires the Apache web server, the mod_perl embedded Perl
interpreter, and the MP3::Info module.

MP3 files are displayed in a list that shows the MP3 title, artist,
duration and bitrate.  Subdirectories are displayed with "CD" icons.
The user can download an MP3 file to disk by clicking on its title,
stream it to an MP3 decoder by clicking on the "play" link. Users can
also stream the entire contents of a directory, or select a subset of
songs to play.

A DEMO is available at http://www.modperl.com/Songs.  In this demo,
stream time is limited to 30 seconds in order to avoid copyright
infringement.
