The GPSTk suite consists of a core library and a set of applications. The
library provides a wide array of functions that solve processing problems
associated with GPS such as processing or using standard formats such as
RINEX. The library is the basis for the more advanced applications
distributed as part of the GPSTk suite.

The -devel package provides static libraries and headers.
