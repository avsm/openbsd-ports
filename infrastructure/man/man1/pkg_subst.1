They are paired as
.Ar dest1
.Ar src1 ,
.Ar dest2
.Ar src2 ...
and each
.Ar src
file is substituted and copied into the corresponding
.Ar dest
file .
.It Xo
.Fl D
.Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value
.Xc
Define
.Ar name
to
.Ar value .
.It Fl g Ar group
change group of destination file to
.Ar group .
.It Fl u Ar owner

.Ar owner .
.El
.Pp
If no
.Ar file
arguments is given,

each
.Ar file
is backed up as
.Ar file.beforesubst
before the substitution occurs.
