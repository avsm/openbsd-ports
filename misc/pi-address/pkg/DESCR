pi-address is a GUI frontend to address databases from a 3Com
PalmPilot.  It can read/edit/save database files in PDB-format. Those
files can be read from or written to the pilot using "pilot-xfer" from
the pilot-link package.

The program can directly read/write the address data from/to the
Pilot.

The programm can also be used as a general address manager without a
3Com PalmPilot. Some of the record fields may be not very meaningful
in this case.
