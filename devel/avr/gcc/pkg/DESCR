This port is an almost carbon-copy of the compiler in-tree, with a few
differences:

- it's taken off a more recent snapshot from gcc 3.3 branch.

- it's not the system compiler, and so it looks for includes in
  /usr/local, and for libraries in /usr/local/lib.

- it can bootstrap itself fully, including ada on i386, and java (though
  java does not yet work. There's an issue with boehm-gc).

- it may build on platforms for which system gcc is still 2.95.3.

- it's a cross-compiler, targetting avr machines
