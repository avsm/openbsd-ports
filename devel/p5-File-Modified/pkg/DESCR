The File::Modified module is intended as a simple method for programs to
detect whether configuration files (or modules they rely on) have
changed.  There are currently two methods of change detection
implemented, mtime and MD5.  The MD5 method will fall back to use
timestamps if the Digest::MD5 module cannot be loaded.
