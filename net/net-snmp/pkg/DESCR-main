Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely used protocol for
monitoring the health of network equipment (eg. routers), computer equipment
and even devices like UPSs. Net-SNMP is a suite of applications used to
implement SNMP v1, SNMP v2c and SNMP v3 using both IPv4 and IPv6.

This package includes the Net-SNMP library, snmpd (an extensible agent
for responding to SNMP queries for management information with built-in
support for a wide range of MIB information modules), snmptrapd (a daemon
to receive and log or forward SNMP notifications), and various command-
line applications to:

- retrieve information from an SNMP-capable device, either using single
  requests (snmpget, snmpgetnext), or multiple requests (snmpwalk,
  snmptable, snmpdelta).
- manipulate configuration information on an SNMP-capable device (snmpset).
- retrieve a fixed collection of information from an SNMP-capable device
  (snmpdf, snmpnetstat, snmpstatus).
- convert between numerical and textual forms of MIB OIDs, and display
  MIB content and structure (snmptranslate).
