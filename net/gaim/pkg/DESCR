Gaim is a GTK+-based multi-protocol instant messaging client. It is
compatible with AIM (Oscar and TOC protocols), ICQ, MSN Messenger,
Yahoo, IRC, Jabber, Gadu-Gadu, and Zephyr networks.

Gaim supports many features of the various networks, such as file
transfer (coming soon), away messages, typing notification, and MSN
window closing notification. It also goes beyond that and provides many
unique features. A few popular features are Buddy Pounces, which give
the ability to notify you, send a message, play a sound, or run a
program when a specific buddy goes away, signs online, or returns from
idle; and plugins, consisting of text replacement, a buddy ticker,
extended message notification, iconify on away, and more.

Gaim integrates well with GNOME 2 and KDE 3.1's system trays.  This
allows you to work with gaim without requiring the buddy list window to
be up at all times.

Gaim is under constant development, and releases are usually frequent.
