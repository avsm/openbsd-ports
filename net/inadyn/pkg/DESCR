inadyn is a C based client used to update DNS entries.  This is a fork of
the original INADYN implementation from Narcis Ilisei. Most of the fixes
and additions from the new "upstream" by Christoph Brill have been added.
However, this project is not a fork off of Christoph's repository, but
rather a reengineered version of the original 1.96.2 release with all
additional patches audited and merged separately. Additionally a further
set of code cleanups, features and bug fixes have been added.
