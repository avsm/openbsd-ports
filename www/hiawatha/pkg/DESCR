Hiawatha is a webserver that has been written with 'being secure' as its
main goal.  Hiawatha has many security features that no other webserver
has.
Hiawatha does not have all the fancy features, but it is fast and really
easy to configure.  Rootjail, run CGIs under any uid/gid you want,
prevention of SQL injection and cross-site scripting, banning of clients
who try such exploits and many other features make it an interesting
webserver for those who need more security than what others are
offering (please note that while the author claims it's secure, this
software has not been audited by the OpenBSD team).
