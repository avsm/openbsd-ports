The `Pre-Make Kit` project is a configuration tool for source dependencies.
It aims to provide an alternative to GNU autoconf.

Goals:
* Avoid the use of scripts in packages that can hide trojans.
* Try to keep the needed dependencies near from zero (actually at zero).
* Make it easy to use for users and developers.
* Provide the package in a free and usable license for everybody (BSD).
* Limit the changes in sources for a transition from autoconf.
