FreeMat is a free environment for rapid engineering and scientific
prototyping and data processing. It is similar to commercial systems
such as MATLAB from Mathworks, and IDL from Research Systems, but is
Open Source. FreeMat includes several novel features such as a codeless
interface to external C/C++/FORTRAN code, parallel/distributed
algorithm development (via MPI), and plotting and visualization
capabilities.

Multi-platform regression test suite is shipped with this version.
Use run_tests command to verify the functionality of your installation.
