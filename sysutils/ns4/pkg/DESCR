ns4 is a command line configuration management tool.  It allows the
automated backup of node (i.e. routers and switches) configurations to
an FTP/SFTP server or local media on a daily basis to create
configuration archives. It can run ad-hoc commands on multiple nodes as
well as custom scripts for automating complex tasks. It uses Perl and
allows you to manipulate the output of commands using regular
expressions within scripts.  Configuration based cartridges are used to
specify new node types, allowing the user to extend its functionality in
a simple and dynamic way.
