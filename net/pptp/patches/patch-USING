+EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION FOR OPENBSD:
+
+On OpenBSD, pptp uses the userspace ppp(8) implementation
+instead of pppd(8). This is a compile-time option.
+
+Having ppp start pptp seems to be working much better
+than the other way round.
+
+This example assumes that we want to configure a gateway running
+OpenBSD to provide PPTP VPN access to a remote network for all hosts
+on our internal LAN.
+
+Let us assume that the VPN server is called vpn-gateway.net,
+and that the default route of our OpenBSD box is 42.42.42.42.
+The remote network is 10.42.0/16; all traffic to this network
+should go through the VPN tunnel.
+
+First, put something like this into /etc/ppp/ppp.conf so we
+can connect to the vpn gateway:
+
+  default:
+	set log Phase Chat LCP IPCP CCP tun command
+  vpn:
+	set device "!PREFIX/sbin/pptp --nolaunchpppd vpn-gateway.net"
+	set authname User
+	set authkey MySecret
+	set mtu max 1490
+	set mru max 1490
+	set mppe 128 stateless
+
+Next, we need to configure routing in /etc/ppp/ppp.linkup.
+Assuming vpn-gateway.net resides inside 10.42.0/16, we have to add a host
+route pointing to vpn-gateway.net in order to avoid a chicken-and-egg
+problem once packets to 10.42.0/16 are routed through the tunnel.
+We also load packet filter anchors for the vpn interface here.
+More on that later.
+
+/etc/ppp/ppp.linkup:
+
+  MYADDR:
+    ! sh -c "/sbin/route add -host vpn-gateway.net 42.42.42.42"
+    ! sh -c "/sbin/route add -net 10.42.0.0 -netmask 255.255.0.0 HISADDR"
+    ! sh -c "/sbin/pfctl -a vpn -f /etc/pf.conf.vpn"
+
+Commands in ppp.linkdown simply undo changes made in ppp.linkup.
+
+/etc/ppp/ppp.linkdown:
+
+  MYADDR:
+    ! sh -c "/sbin/pfctl -a vpn -F all"
+    ! sh -c "/sbin/route delete -net 10.42.0.0 -netmask 255.255.0.0 HISADDR"
+    ! sh -c "/sbin/route delete -host vpn-gateway.net 42.42.42.42"
+
+To make pf aware of the vpn anchors, put these lines into the
+nat and filter sections of /etc/pf.conf, respectively:
+
+  nat-anchor	"vpn"
+  anchor	"vpn"
+
+Now define vpn anchor rules in /etc/pf.conf.vpn:
+
+  int_if=xl0
+  vpn_if=tun0
+
+  nat on $vpn_if from $int_if:network to any -> ($vpn_if)
+
+  pass out on $vpn_if keep state
+
+  # Allow ping from remote, and explicitly make sure our replies are
+  # routed back through the tunnel.
+  pass in on $vpn_if reply-to ($vpn_if vpn-gateway.net) \
+	inet proto icmp icmp-type echoreq keep state
+
+  # Same for ssh.
+  pass in on $vpn_if reply-to ($vpn_if vpn-gateway.net) proto tcp \
+	from any to ($vpn_if) port ssh flags S/SA keep state
+
+
+Connect by running:
+
+	ppp -ddial vpn
+
+To terminate the connection, kill the ppp process. It creates a PID
+file in /var/run/tunX.pid, where X is the number of the tun device used.
