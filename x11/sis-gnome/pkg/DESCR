Is your little sister trying out OpenBSD?

Does she all of the sudden call you more often than when she used Windows?

Do you always have to guess-work pkg_add-ing a typical desktop environment?

Introducing Sis-GNOME -- the gnome package your little sister always dreamed
about! You don't believe, just ask the thousands of little sisters around the
world that are happily using sis-gnome for years:

``Ever since I pkg_add-ed sis-gnome, me and my brother kind of grew apart...''
   -- 16 year old Bojana, Ljubljana, Slovenia

``I've started using sis-gnome because all the cool kids in high-school were
using it... I'm still unpopular, but at least I can work on my OpenBSD desktop''
   -- 15 year old Penny, Texas, USA

``Ever sice I saw the commit message, I knew something had to be done...''
   -- 40-ish old guy Marc, Paris, France
