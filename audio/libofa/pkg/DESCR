The Open Fingerprint Architecture normalizes, extracts frequencies,
and creates an array representing the frequency data in an audio
file.  This data-chunk (so called acoustic fingerprint) was designed
for use with the MusicDNS service and can be used by the MusicBrainz
tagger to identify audio files.
