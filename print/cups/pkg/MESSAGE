To enable CUPS, execute '${PREFIX}/sbin/cups-enable' as root.
To disable CUPS, execute '${PREFIX}/sbin/cups-disable' as root.

To start cups at boot time, add the following to
${SYSCONFDIR}/rc.local:

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/cupsd ]; then
        echo -n ' cupsd';       ${PREFIX}/sbin/cupsd
fi

Starting cupsd will overwrite /etc/printcap. A backup copy of this file
is saved as /etc/printcap.pre-cups by '${PREFIX}/sbin/cups-enable'
and will be restored when you run '${PREFIX}/sbin/cups-disable'.
