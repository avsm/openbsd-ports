+@b{create project} @i{new-name}
+
+Creates a new project and a new empty branch and binds @i{new-name} to the
+new empty branch in the user's directory.  All projects are internally 
+referenced by branches and all operations are done relative to a branch. 
+Thus, you can always find the associated project name by listing any branch.

+See also:  @b{ls}, @b{create branch}
