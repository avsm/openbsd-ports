interface to ICS (Internet Chess Servers) like FICS and chessd,
and to chess engines like GNU Chess, Sjeng and Crafty.

eboard is currently under development, and its primary purpose is
serving as interface to FICS.  About 95% of FICS support is in place,
and it is expected to be complete in the next release.
