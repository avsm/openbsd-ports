OggConvert is a small Gnome utility which uses GStreamer to convert
(almost) any media file to the patent-free Ogg Vorbis, Theora and Dirac
formats.

Since oggconvert relies on GStreamer for encoding and decoding, you may
need to install more codecs from the gst-plugins-{bad,base,good,ugly}
packages according to the formats you want to work with.
