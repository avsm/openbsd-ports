This package contains documents which will be packaged together and
shipped as gnome-user-docs in the core GNOME distribution.  They should 
be documents targetted for end-users of GNOME and have general GNOME
applicability.
The GNOME Documentation Project (GDP) is responsible for this
documentation.
