ent - a program which applies various tests (Entropy, Chi-square,
Arithmetic Mean, Monte Carlo Value for Pi, Serial Correlation
Coefficient) to sequences of bytes stored in files and reports the
results of those tests. The program is useful for evaluating pseudo
random number generators for encryption and statistical sampling
applications, compression algorithms, and other applications where the
information density of a file is of interest.
