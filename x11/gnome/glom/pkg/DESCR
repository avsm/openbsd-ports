With Glom you can design database systems - the database and the user
interface.

*  Glom has high-level features such as relationships, lookups, related
   fields, related records, calculated fields, drop-down choices,
   searching, reports, users and groups.
*  Glom keeps things simple. It has Numeric, Text, Date, Time, Boolean,
   and Image field types.
*  Glom systems require almost no programming, but you may use Python
   for calculated fields or buttons.
*  Each Glom system can be translated for multiple languages and
   countries.

The design is loosely based on FileMaker Pro, but with a separate
database server. Its simple framework should be enough to implement most
database applications.
