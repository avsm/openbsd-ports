To use lightsquid (with non-chrooted apache, httpd -u), give the www
user permissions to access squid logs; either like this, or some other
way:

# usermod -G _squid www

Add the following lines to httpd.conf:

<Directory "${INSTDIR}">
   AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
   AllowOverride All
</Directory>

Then restart apache.

If you have problems, ${INSTDIR}/check-setup.pl will check
for a few common causes.
