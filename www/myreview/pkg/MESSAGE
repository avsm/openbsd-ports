MyReview has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
 # ln -s ../myreview /var/www/htdocs/myreview
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

and proceed to complete the installation by reading:
${INSTDIR}/README as well as ${INSTDIR}/myreview.pdf
