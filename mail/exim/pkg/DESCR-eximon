Exim is a mail transfer agent (MTA) for hosts that are running Unix or Unix-
like operating systems. It was designed on the assumption that it would be run
on hosts that are permanently connected to the Internet. However, it can
be used on intermittently connected hosts with suitable configuration
adjustments.

This is the X11-Exim monitor.
