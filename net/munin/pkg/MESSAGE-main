Install p5-Net-SNMP to use the optional SNMP-based monitors.

To have munin-node start at boot time, you should create symlinks
in ${SYSCONFDIR}/munin/plugins as described in the manual (manually or
using the output from munin-node-configure --shell), adapt
${SYSCONFDIR}/munin/munin-node.conf if necessary (e.g. if a remote server
will query this node), and insert the following into /etc/rc.local:

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/munin-node ]; then
        install -d -o _munin /var/run/munin
        echo -n ' munin-node';   ${PREFIX}/sbin/munin-node
fi
