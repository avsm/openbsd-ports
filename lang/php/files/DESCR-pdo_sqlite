The PHP Data Objects (PDO) extension defines a lightweight,
consistent interface for accessing databases in PHP.
Each database driver that implements the PDO interface can
expose database-specific features as regular extension functions.

pdo_sqlite is a driver that implements the PHP Data Objects (PDO)
interface to enable access to SQLite 3 databases.
