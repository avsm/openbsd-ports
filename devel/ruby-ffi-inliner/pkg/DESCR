With ffi-inliner you can run C code within your ruby script:
* Mix C snippets in your Ruby code and gulp it on the fly!
* It's based on Ruby-FFI so the C code you inject is portable across
  Ruby implementations!
* Yep, it means that you can run it on JRuby too!
* Fast compilation through tcc
* But it can use the system's compiler (e.g. gcc) on those platforms
  that don't support tcc (e.g. OSX) or that don't have it installed
