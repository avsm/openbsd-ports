.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command
extracts subtitles from a dvd using
.Xr mplayer 1
and passes them to
.Xr gocr 1
for conversion into srt files.
The resulting files are named
.Pa output.srt ,
where a
.Sq %d
in output is replaced with the subtitle stream number
.Ar sid .
.Pp
.Nm 
is a simple shell-script that acts as a front-end and can be
customized as needed.
.Pp
The extraction is interactive, as
.Xr gocr 1
often will need some help recognizing some character shapes.

The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Flooutput
.It Fl d Ar device
Select dvd device.
Defaults to 
.Pa /dev/rcd0c .

options to specify an option with arguments.

.It Fl m Ar mencoder-cmd
