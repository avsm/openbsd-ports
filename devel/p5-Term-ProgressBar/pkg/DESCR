Term::ProgressBar provides a simple progress bar on the terminal, to let
the user know that something is happening, roughly how much stuff has
been done, and maybe an estimate at how long remains.

A typical use sets up the progress bar with a number of items to do, and
then calls update to update the bar whenever an item is processed.
