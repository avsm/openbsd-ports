Often you want to create components that can be added to a class
arbitrarily. This module makes it easy for the end user to use these
components. Instead of requiring the user to create a named class with
the desired roles applied, or applying roles to the instance one-by-one,
he can just pass a traits parameter to the class's new_with_traits
constructor.
