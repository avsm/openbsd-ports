While "tie" in Perl allows tying to an arbitrary object, the class in
question must support this in it's implementation of TIEHASH, TIEARRAY
or whatever.

Tie::ToObject provides a very tie constructor that simply returns the
object it was given as it's first argument.
That way the side effects of calling $object->TIEHASH are avoided.
