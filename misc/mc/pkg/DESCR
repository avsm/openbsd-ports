The Midnight Commander is a directory browsing tool which bears a
certain remote resemblance to John Socha's Norton Commander for DOS.
It is feature packed:

        o Built in Virtual File System: manipulate remote files
        systems through the ftp protocol or Midnight Commander's own
        mcfs protocol.  Browse tar, compressed tar files, rpm, zip,
        cpio, lha and rar files with a single click.  

        o All of the Midnight Commander operations work with the virtual
        file system, enabling you to do complex tasks.

        o Mouse support on the Linux console and under X11's xterms. 

        o Note that the key binding to use the menu and to exit from
	Midnight Commander are F9 and F10 respectively.  Since OpenBSD
	uses these keys to swap VT's, you must hit 'Esc' + 9 and 
	'Esc' + 0 to use the menu's and to exit
