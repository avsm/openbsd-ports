The MJPEG-tools are a basic set of utilities for editing, playing back,
filtering and encoding video under UNIX-like operating systems.

There are two FLAVORS for this port:

  quicktime - builds the package with support for reading and writing
              quicktime ".mov" files

  optimized - builds the package with SSE instructions. Packages built
              with this FLAVOR might not run on systems that are not SSE
	      capable.
