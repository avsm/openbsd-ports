libdvdcss is a simple library designed for accessing DVDs like a block
device without having to worry about the decryption.

Can be controlled through environment variables:

DVDCSS_VERBOSE={0|1|2}: 
    0: no error messages, no debug messages,
    1: only error messages (this is the default)
    2: error and debug messages

DVDCSS_CACHE=directory:
    specify a directory in which to store title key values. This will
    speed up descrambling of DVDs which are in the cache. The DVDCSS_CACHE
    directory is created if it does not exist, and a subdirectory is
    created, named after the DVD's title or manufacturing date.
