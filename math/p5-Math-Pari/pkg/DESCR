This package is a Perl interface to famous library PARI for
numerical/scientific/number-theoretic calculations. It allows use of
most PARI functions as Perl functions, and (almost) seamless merging of
PARI and Perl data. In what follows we suppose prior knowledge of what
PARI is (see <ftp://megrez.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari>, or
Math::libPARI).
