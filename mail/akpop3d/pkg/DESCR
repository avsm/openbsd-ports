akpop3d is a POP3 daemon aimed to be small and secure.  It is
stand-alone, very small, easy to modify.  Despite its small size, it
offers a lot of features.  It is completely RFC 1939 compliant.  It
features POP3-over-SSL (based on OpenSSL), and can use a separate
authfile (enabling authentication of virtual users who do not have an
entry in /etc/passwd).
