WordGenerator generates hypothetical words from specifications of their
syllable structure. You specify the maximum length of the words in
syllables, the abstract structure of syllables in the language (in terms
of such units as consonants and vowels or onsets and rhymes), and the
actual sounds that comprise each abstract class (e.g. the list of vowels
in the language) and WordGenerator then generates the words that conform
to this specification.
