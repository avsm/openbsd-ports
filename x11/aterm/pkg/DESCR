aterm is a color vt102 terminal emulator, based on rxvt 2.4.8 with
additions for fast transparency.

It was created with AfterStep users in mind, but is not tied to any
libraries, and can be used anywhere.

Flavors:
	big5 - Build with support for Chinese text input.
	lite - Build without any image library dependencies.
