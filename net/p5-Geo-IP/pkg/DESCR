This module uses a file based database. This database simply contains IP
blocks as keys, and countries as values. This database should be more
complete and accurate than reverse DNS lookups.

This module can be used to automatically select the geographically closest
mirror, to analyze your web server logs to determine the countries of your
visitors, for credit card fraud detection, and for software export controls.
