Thanks to Mr. Edward Der-Hua Liu and others who developed the xcin
system. With the wonderful program, we can do a lot of operations with
Chinese under the X Window System in the UN*X world. As time goes on,
more and more people use it, and more and more comments appear. The
package hs been upgraded with time but it seems that the install process
is not convenient and self-consistent. These confuse a lot of people,
especially for new users in the UN*X world. We often see the `Big FAQs'
about xcin such as `how can I install the Chinese fonts' or `the cj2cin
command not found' or `the crxvt terminal is too big!!' or something
appears in the newsgroup again and again. In fact, such problems are
easy to remedy. Because I really like this program and feel that I may
do something to improve this package, I try my best to re-write the
Makefiles and auto-configuration programs of this package to try to
solve these troubles. This comes the `xcin-2.3' project.
