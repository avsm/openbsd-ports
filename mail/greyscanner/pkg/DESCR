greyscanner compliments OpenBSD spamd(8) greylisting by applying
additional heuristics to greylisted hosts.  Additional heuristics
include: confirm senders email address is valid, confirm existence of
the senders MX or A record in DNS, confirm recipient address(es) is
valid, and more.  Offending hosts are flagged as 'trapped' in the spamd
database.
