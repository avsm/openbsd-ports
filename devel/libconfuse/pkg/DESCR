libConfuse is a configuration file parser library, and written in C. It
supports sections and (lists of) values (strings, integers, floats,
booleans or other sections), as well as some other features (such as
single/double-quoted strings, environment variable expansion, functions
and nested include statements). It makes it very easy to add
configuration file capability to a program using a simple API.
