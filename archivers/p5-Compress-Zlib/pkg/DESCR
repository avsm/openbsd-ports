The Compress::Zlib module provides a Perl interface to the zlib
compression library (which is part of OpenBSD).  Most of the
functionality provided by zlib is available in Compress::Zlib.

The module can be split into two general areas of functionality,
namely in-memory compression/decompression and read/write access
to gzip files.
