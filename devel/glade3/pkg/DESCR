Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick & easy development of user
interfaces for the GTK+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment.

The user interfaces designed in Glade are saved as XML, and by using the
libglade library these can be loaded by applications dynamically as
needed.

By using libglade, Glade XML files can be used in numerous programming
languages including C, C++, Java, Perl, Python, C#, Pike, Ruby, Haskell,
Objective Caml and Scheme. Adding support for other languages is easy
too.
