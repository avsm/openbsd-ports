+---------------
| To finish the install of ${PKGNAME}, you need
| to enable the module using the following command
|
|   ${PREFIX}/sbin/mod_gzip-enable
|
| Also, copy the following file into your Apache config:
| ${PREFIX}/share/examples/mod_gzip/mod_gzip.conf.sample
|
| If you already have Apache running on your machine,
| you should not use "apachectl restart" - instead,
| you fully stop and then restart the server.
