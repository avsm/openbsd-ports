onesixtyone takes a different approach to SNMP scanning. It takes advantage
of the fact that SNMP is a connectionless protocol and sends all SNMP
requests as fast as it can. Then the scanner waits for responses to come
back and logs them, in a fashion similar to Nmap ping sweeps. By default
onesixtyone waits for 10 milliseconds between sending packets, which is
adequate for 100MBs switched networks. The user can adjust this value
via the -w command line option. If set to 0, the scanner will send packets
as fast as the kernel would accept them, which may lead to packet drop.

Running onesixtyone on a class B network (switched 100MBs with 1Gbs backbone)
with -w 10 gives us a performance of 3 seconds per class C, with no dropped
packets. All 65536 IP addresses were scanned in less than 13 minutes.
