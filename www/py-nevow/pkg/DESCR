Divmod Nevow is a web application construction kit written in Python.
It is designed to allow the programmer to express as much of the view
logic as desired in Python, and includes a pure Python XML expression
syntax named stan to facilitate this. However it also provides rich
support for designer-edited templates, using a very small XML
attribute language to provide bi-directional template manipulation
capability. 

Nevow also includes Divmod Athena, a "two way web" implementation,
providing a two-way bridge between Python code on the server and
JavaScript code on the client.  Modular portions of a page, known as
"athena fragments" in the server python and "athena widgets" in the
client javascript, can be individually developed and placed on any
Nevow-rendered page with a small template renderer.  Athena abstracts
the intricacies of HTTP communication, session security, and
browser-specific bugs behind a simple remote-method-call interface,
where individual widgets or fragments can call remote methods on their
client or server peer with one method: "callRemote".
