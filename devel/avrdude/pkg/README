Programming Arduio devices
==========================
If you're planning on programming *duino devices (with an FTDI chip)
using avrdude, you'll want to invoke it something like this:

    avrdude -b19200 -P /dev/cuaU0 -c arduino -p m328p -U flash:w:blink.hex

Or replace 'm328p' if your board doesn't have an ATmega328p chip, but an
ATmega168 chip (which is the case with Diecimila boards).

For the Uno and newer boards, a baudrate of 115200 needs to be used to
program the device.
