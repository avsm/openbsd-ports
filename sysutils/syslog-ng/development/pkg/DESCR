syslog-ng, as the name shows, is a syslogd replacement, but with new
functionality for the new generation. The original syslogd allows messages
only to be sorted based on priority/facility pairs; syslog-ng adds the
possibility to filter based on message contents using regular expressions.
The new configuration scheme is intuitive and powerful. Forwarding logs
over TCP and remembering all forwarding hops makes it ideal for firewalled
environments.
