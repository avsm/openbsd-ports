milter is a Python extension module to enable Python scripts to attach
to Sendmail's libmilter API, enabling filtering of messages as they
arrive.  Since it's a script, you can do anything you want to the
message - screen out viruses, collect statistics, add or modify headers,
etc.  You can, at any point, tell Sendmail to reject, discard, or accept
the message.
