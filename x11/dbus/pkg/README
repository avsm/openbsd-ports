To start a session bus instance of dbus-daemon (needed by at least gvfs
aware applications and ${PREFIX}/share/dbus-1/services/*.service),
add the following lines in .xinitrc or .xsession before starting the
window manager (see dbus-launch(1) for more info) -- note that some
session managers, e.g. gnome-session(1) already do this for you.

if [ -z "${DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS}" ]; then
	eval `dbus-launch --auto-syntax --exit-with-session`
fi
