This plugin gathers simple statistics from one or more trace files and
allows you to save the results in a user-provided output stream. The
analysis steps performed are as follows:

    * Basic counts:
      Counts the total number of packets scanned and the number of
      non-IP packets.
    * IP protocol usage:
      Counts the number of packets and the number of bytes per IP
      protocol type.
    * UDP/TCP port usage:
      Counts the number of packets and the number of bytes for each pair
      of TCP source and destination port numbers seen. You can also get
      aggregate counts for source ports and for destination ports.
    * UDP/TCP flow usage:
      Counts the number of packets and the number of bytes for each
      individual TCP flow encountered.

The resulting numbers can be written to a separate output stream for
each analysis category, or be combined arbitrarily. The resulting output
contains absolute numbers and percentage values, and contains comments
starting with a "#" at the beginning of the line.
