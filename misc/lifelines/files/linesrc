# Note that paths are assigned with :=
# Other values are assigned with =
# The distinction is that using plain = means that
# backslash escapes are enabled:
#  \t means tab, \n means carriage return
# We don't want these enabled in paths, because they might
# occur naturally in path names under MS-Windows.
#
# All variables here are available to report programs
# via the report language function getproperty, so, for
# example, the user email property (which is built-in under
# UNIX), may be specified here like so:
#user.email=user@domain.name
# Similarly the user fullname property (also built-in under
# UNIX) may be specified like so:
#user.fullname=myname
# the addr property is a one line version of your address
#user.addr=1234 Some Street, Some City, State 00000
