You will need to edit /etc/rc.local as appropriate and add a
section similar to the following so that privoxy is started
automatically:

    if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/privoxy ]; then
            echo -n ' privoxy';
            ${PREFIX}/sbin/privoxy --user _privoxy._privoxy \
                    ${SYSCONFDIR}/privoxy/config
    fi
