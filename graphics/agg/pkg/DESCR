Anti-Grain Geometry (AGG) is a general purpose graphical toolkit
written completely in standard and platform independent C++. It can be
used in many areas of computer programming where high quality 2D
graphics is an essential part of the project. For example, if you
render 2D geographic maps, AGG is a must. AGG uses only C++ and
standard C runtime functions. The basic algorithms don't even use C++
Standard Template Library. Thus, AGG can be used in a very large number
of applications, including embedded systems.
