fobbit is software to use the Creative Labs USB VOIP Blaster.  The
application is not very elegant but it gets the job done.  It uses TCP
for signaling and UDP for the voice traffic.  It can be configured to
use TCP for both types of traffic since this plays better with
firewalls, NAT, and other internet connection-sharing schemes.  With
this software, most of the work is done at the user level, the drivers
only provide access to the usb-pipes implemented in the hardware.
