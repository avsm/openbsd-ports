 This program writes a 'save2dsk.bin' hibernation file to stdout. To\n\
 use it you should do something like this:\n\
 \n\
-1) create a type c (FAT32) partition on your laptop\n\
-2) format the partition with 'mkdosfs'\n\
-3) mount the partition as VFAT\n\
+1) define the first partition on the disk as type 16 in fdisk(8) at least\n\
+   as big as your amount of system memory\n\
+2) format the partition with 'newfs_msdos -F 16 /dev/rwd0i'\n\
+3) mount the partition with mount_msdos(8)\n\
 4) create the 'save2dsk.bin' file on the partition using something like\n\
       tphdisk 280 > save2dsk.bin\n\
-5) Do a full reboot\n\
+5) do a full reboot\n\
 \n\
 The only parameter is the size in megabytes of the save file. This\n\
 needs to be at least as big as your main memory + video memory +2MB, but you\n\
 can make it larger if you want to.\n\
-\n\
-You should also be able to use this to create a hibernation partition\n\
-by directing the output to the right device (eg. /dev/hdaX) and\n\
-setting the partition type to A0.  I haven't tried this as my thinkpad\n\
-doesn't seem to support hibernation partitions.\n\
