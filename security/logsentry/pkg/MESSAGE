The logsentry configuration files have been installed at
${SYSCONFDIR}/logsentry.
Please view these files and change the configuration to meet your needs.

Currently logsentry will check the following files:

/var/log/messages
/var/log/maillog
/var/log/authlog
/var/log/secure
/var/log/daemon
/var/log/xferlog

Edit ${SYSCONFDIR}/logsentry/logsentry.sh
if you want to add more files.

Be sure to configure your crontab as indicated by
${PREFIX}/share/doc/logsentry/INSTALL
so that logsentry is run regularly.
