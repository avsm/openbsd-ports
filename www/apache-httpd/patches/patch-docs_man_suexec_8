-suexec is used by the Apache HTTP Server to switch to another user before executing CGI programs\&. In order to achieve this, it must run as root\&. Since the HTTP daemon normally doesn't run as root, the suexec executable needs the setuid bit set and must be owned by root\&. It should never be writable for any other person than root\&.
