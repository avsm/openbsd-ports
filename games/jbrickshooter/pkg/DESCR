The game field is a square of a hundred cells. The game starts with some
colored bricks arranged randomly in the field. Empty cells are black.

Each side of the field has three layers of bricks. Any brick that can
move will show an arrow when the mouse is over it. Clicking the mouse
starts the brick moving through the field in the direction of its arrow.
When the brick hits another brick it stops.
