 The CGI wrapper is part of the Hiawatha webserver. See hiawatha(1) for more information about Hiawatha.
 
 .SH CGI WRAPPER
-The CGI wrapper can be used to run certain CGI programs with a different userid then Hiawatha's userid. It replaces the HostId option in previous versions. To function properly, the CGI wrapper binary needs the su-bit. To prevent abuse, it has the necessary security checks. As a result, the CGI wrapper can only be executed by Hiawatha. Via the configuration file (/etc/hiawatha/cgi_wrapper.conf), you can specify what the CGI wrapper is allowed to execute.
