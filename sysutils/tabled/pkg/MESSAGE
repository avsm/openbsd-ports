Tabled uses a fifo to accept commands.  That fifo must be manually created
in this version of tabled before the daemon is started:

	# mkfifo /var/run/tabled.sock

To automatically start tabled at system startup time, you can add the following
commands to /etc/rc.local:

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/tabled ]; then
	echo -n ' tabled'
	mkfifo -m 600 /var/run/tabled.sock
	${PREFIX}/sbin/tabled
fi

Make sure to set the permsission of the fifo right.
