This module implements a configurable web traversal engine, for a robot
or other web agent. Given an initial web page (URL), the Robot will get
the contents of that page, and extract all links on the page, adding
them to a list of URLs to visit.

Features of the Robot module include:

    * Follows the Robot Exclusion Protocol.
    * Supports the META element proposed extensions to the Protocol.
    * Implements many of the Guidelines for Robot Writers.
    * Configurable.
    * Builds on standard Perl 5 modules for WWW, HTTP, HTML, etc.
