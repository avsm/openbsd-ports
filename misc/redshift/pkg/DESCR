Redshift adjusts the color temperature of your screen according to your
surroundings. This may help your eyes hurt less if you are working in
front of the screen at night.

The color temperature is set according to the position of the sun. A
different color temperature is set during night and daytime. During
twilight and early morning, the color temperature transitions smoothly
from night to daytime temperature to allow your eyes to slowly adapt.
