xfce4-minicmd-plugin puts a small entry widget onto your panel.  You can
execute programs by typing their names in the widget and hitting Enter
or Ctrl+Enter.  The latter runs the command in a terminal.  It maintains
history which is shared with xfrun4.  This history can be accessed by
the Up and Down keys.
