Linley's dungeon-crawl is a dungeon slashing game. 
It's very similar to nethack, to the extent that 
most of the keys are the same, but it is a much harder game.

Development has been somewhat sporadic, there might be a 4.1 version
at some point.

It's a text terminal-only game, but you can get colors, provided your
TERM defines them.

This package can coexist with later versions of dungeon-crawl, to allow
players to finish their game.
