"Mail::Sender" provides an object oriented interface to
sending mails.  It doesn't need any outer program. It con-
nects to a mail server directly from Perl, using Socket.

This package contains no default configuration, so the
Mail::Sender object should have an smtp parameter.

Some extra modules (Digest::HMAC_MD5 and Authen::NTLM) may
be needed for some methods of sending email.
