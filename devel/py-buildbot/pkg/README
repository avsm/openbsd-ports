Using BuildBot master in an OpenBSD environment
===============================================

On OpenBSD, the BuildBot package has an associated _buildbot user for
running the master.  The default master directory is expected to be
found in ${HOMEDIR}.  Before being run for the first time, the
master directory must be initialized.  This is done as follows:

    $ sudo -u _buildbot buildbot create-master ${HOMEDIR}

The next step is to create a ${HOMEDIR}/master.cfg configuration
file that fits your needs.  Please refer to the BuildBot documentation
on how to do so.
