When run as the root user, the polipo daemon will drop privileges to
that of the _polipo user and its login group.

Some sample configuration files have been installed in
${SYSCONFDIR}/polipo.

Additionally, you may wish to start polipo at system start-up time via
the /etc/rc.local script.

if [ X"${polipo}" == X"YES" -a -x ${PREFIX}/bin/polipo ]; then
        echo -n ' polipo'
        ${PREFIX}/bin/polipo daemonise=yes
fi

and adding "polipo=YES" to /etc/rc.conf.local
