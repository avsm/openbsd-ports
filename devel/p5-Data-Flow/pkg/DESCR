The module Data::Flow provides its services via objects.
The objects may be obtained by the usual

         $request = new Data::Flow $recipes;

paradigm. The argument $recipes is a hash reference, which
provides the rules for request processing. The objects
support two methods, set() and get(). The first one is
used to provide input data for processing, the second one
to obtain the output.
