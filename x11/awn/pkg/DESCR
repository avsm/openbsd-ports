Avant Window Navigator (Awn) is a dock-like bar which sits at the bottom
of the screen. It has support for launchers, task lists, and third party
applets.

The Awn project is the development of the 'dock',
avant-window-navigator, and its corresponding shared library 'libawn',
which is used to develop applets.
