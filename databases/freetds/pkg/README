The main FreeTDS package uses GnuTLS if making an encrypted connection.
This requires thread support; due to limitations of OpenBSD's current
userland threads implementation, it is not always possible to load the
correct library automatically.

If you see errors like "undefined symbol 'pthread_mutex_unlock'" or
processes exiting when making a connection to an encrypted server, you
will need to manually load the pthread shared library; you can do this
by setting "LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libpthread.so" in the environment.

Alternatively you may use the "openssl" flavor of the port; the licenses
of FreeTDS and OpenSSL are incompatible, therefore compiled packages may not
be distributed, so you will need to build this yourself.

Note that this does not apply for cleartext connections; the problem is
only seen when the encryption library is initialized.
