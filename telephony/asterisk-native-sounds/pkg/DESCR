This is an optional collection of sound files, with the same content and 
in the same voice as the originals, but in a bigger and better format (uLaw) 
to avoid the need for transcoding when talking uLaw to a phone.

From the homepage: "While you're thinking about how much processor
time you are saving and how much happier your users will be with
better sounds, why don't you send me some money?  Paypal donations
are accepted at paypal@krisk.org. Thanks!"
