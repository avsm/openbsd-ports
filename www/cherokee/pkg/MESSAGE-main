To complete the installation, you need to configure cherokee.  As root:
 # cherokee-admin -b [IP]
(where IP is a trusted IP used to configure your web server)

If you want to run cherokee on boot, add these lines to /etc/rc.local:

if [ X"${cherokee_flags}" != X"NO" ]; then
	echo -n ' cherokee'
	${PREFIX}/sbin/cherokee-guardian ${cherokee_flags} 1> /dev/null
fi

for admin management:

if [ X"${cherokee-admin_flags}" != X"NO" ]; then
	echo -n ' cherokee-admin'
	${PREFIX}/sbin/cherokee-admin ${cherokee-admin_flags} 1> /dev/null &
fi

and in /etc/rc.conf.local :

cherokee_flags="-d"	# use -d to run in daemon mode
cheroke_admin_flags=NO	# use -b if you want listen on ALL interfaces
