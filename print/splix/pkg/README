Enhancing printing output
-------------------------

Color printers needs color profile files to get better results.  These
files are provided by your printer manufacturer and you have to install
them manually.  To do that, download the linux official drivers and
copy the "cms" directory under:
  ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/cups/model/<manufacturer>/
where <manufacturer> is either samsung, xerox or dell.

Samsung color profile files are available at
  http://splix.ap2c.org/samsung_cms.tar.bz2


Upgrade notice
--------------

If you are upgrading your current version, you MUST delete your printer
in the CUPS interface and install it again. This operation MUST be done
since CUPS makes a copy of the PPD file and this file is modified
between versions.
