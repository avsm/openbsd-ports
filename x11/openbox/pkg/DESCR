Openbox is a window manager for the X11 windowing system. It was originally
based on Blackbox and currently remains very similar, even using Blackbox
styles for its themeing.

Openbox is written to be fast. It is designed to be both fast in functionality
and in performance. Meaning that you, as a user, can do what you want quickly,
and the window manager will respond quickly to your every request.

Another goal of Openbox is to be usable. What good is a piece of software if
it is hard to use and, then ends up going unused. Openbox aims to take its
original codebase to the next level. To make everything - from shading a
window to configuring the window manager - easier. But to do this while
maintaining the bloat-free approach that has been present in Blackbox from
the beginning. To present a slim, speedy, attractive
window-manager-alternative for everybody.
