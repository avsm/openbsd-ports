Note: the _nfcapd user has been added to group www.

To proceed with an installation or upgrade, adjust ${SYSCONFDIR}/nfsen.conf
as required and run the configuration tool:

# install-nfsen.pl ${SYSCONFDIR}/nfsen.conf

If your httpd runs in a chroot jail of /var/www you may adapt like this:

# mkdir -p /var/www/var/db
# mv /var/db/nfsen /var/www/var/db/nfsen
# ln -s /var/www/var/db/nfsen /var/db/nfsen

To start the daemon at boot, you may add this to /etc/rc.local:

[ -x ${PREFIX}/bin/nfsen ] && ${PREFIX}/bin/nfsen start
