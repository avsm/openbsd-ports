The PostgreSQL Toolbox is a collection of small programs to aid the
PostgreSQL administrator and developer.

* pgcomment parses SQL files which should contain DDL and 
  (javadoc) comments and can generate the appropriate COMMENT ON 
  statements or HTML and LaTeX fragments.

* pgstat shows the queries the PostgreSQL server is currently 
  executing and optionally idle connections.

* listdb lists all databases like the \l+ command in psql.

* dbsize tells the overall size of a single database.

* dbrelationsize tells the size of tables, view, indices, 
  sequences of a specific database.

* dbstat prints the collected statistics about a database.

* listlock prints locks held by a database.

* xloginfo shows the current write and insert location in the xlogs.

* pg_file2str reads a file from STDIN or the filename given as its first 
  command line argument and prints the file properly escaped as a
  PostgreSQL string literal to STDOUT.
