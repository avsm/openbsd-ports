Crimson Fields is a tactical war game in the tradition of Battle Isle.
The outcome of the war lies in your hands.  You decide which units are
sent to the front lines, and when to unleash the reserves. Your mission
objectives range from defending strategically vital locations to simply
destroying all enemy forces in the area.  Protect supply convoys or raid
enemy facilities to uncover technological secrets or fill your storage
bays so you can repair damaged units or build new ones in your own
factories. Lead your troops to victory!
