X-platform Music Multiplexing System 2 is a client-server audio player.
Client-server model allows XMMS2 to have various multiple (remote)
interfaces (as clients):
    * Command line interfaces
    * GTK clients (matching GNOME & Xfce4 look and feel)
    * KDE clients (matching KDE look and feel)
It has a wide format support and can play over different media.
It comes with Medialib, a database-driven media library which stores

and new playlists easily made. The media library can be easily queried
and managed using Collections.
