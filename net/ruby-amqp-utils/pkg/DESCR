CLI utility programs for interacting with an AMQP queue. Using these
utilities, one can interact with an AMQP queue from the command line or
via a shell script.

These utilities have been tested against RabbitMQ, but they should work
with other AMQP compliant queues. They depend on the amqp gem available
at <http://github.com/tmm1/amqp>.
