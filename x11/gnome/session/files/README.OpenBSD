The OpenBSD/GNOME desktop
=========================

* Introduction
  ------------
The gnome-session package only takes care of installing minimal GNOME
libraries.  For a satisfying GNOME user experience, it is advised to
install at least the following packages:
    sudo pkg_add eog \
	file-roller \
	gdm \
	gedit \
	gnome-audio \
	gnome-backgrounds \
	gnome-control-center \
	gnome-media \
	gnome-panel \
	gnome-screensaver \
	gnome-terminal \
	gnome-themes \
	gnome-utils

(xscreensaver can be used instead of gnome-screensaver)

This file will briefly explain to you how to make this experience more
pleasant.

* A note about accessibility
  --------------------------
If you want to make the GNOME applications "accessible" (e.g. nautilus),
you'll need to install the libgail-gnome package which adds ATK
interfaces for libbonoboui and libgnomeui widgets.

* Installing more packages
