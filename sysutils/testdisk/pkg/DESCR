TestDisk is a powerful free data recovery software! It was primarily
designed to help recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks
bootable again when these symptoms are caused by faulty software,
certain types of viruses or human error (such as accidentally deleting a
Partition Table). Partition table recovery using TestDisk is really
easy.

PhotoRec is a file data recovery software designed to recover lost files
including video, documents and archives from Hard Disks and CDRom and
lost pictures (thus, its 'Photo Recovery' name) from digital camera
memory. PhotoRec ignores the filesystem and goes after the underlying
data, so it will still work even if your media's filesystem has been
severely damaged or re-formatted.
