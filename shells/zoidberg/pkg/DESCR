Zoidberg provides a modular Perl shell written, configured, and operated 
entirely in Perl. It aspires to be a fully operational login shell with all 
the features one normally expects. But it also gives direct access to Perl 
objects and data structures from the command line, and allows you to run Perl 
code within the scope of your commandline.
