Gigolo is a frontend to easily manage connections to remote filesystems
using GIO/GVfs. It allows you to quickly connect/mount a remote
filesystem and manage bookmarks of such.

GVfs is an userspace virtual filesystem and the successor of GnomeVfs
but doesn't depend on Gnome itself. It only requires a recent GLib
version and a properly setup DBus system. Then it provides almost
transparent access to remote resources like FTP or SFTP (SSH)
connections, SMB (windows shares) or special resources like the Trash
(trash://), Burn (burn://) or even accessing your digital photo camera
(gphoto2://).
