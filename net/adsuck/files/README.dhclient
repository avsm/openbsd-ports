To make dhclient play nice with adsuck, patching dhclient-script is necessary:

 cd /sbin
 patch -p0 < ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/adsuck/dhclient-script.diff

dhclient-script will then, providing adsuck exists and adsuck_flags != "NO"
will avoid /etc/resolv.conf and write instead /var/adsuck/files/resolv.conf,
and give adsuck a HUP to reload that file.
