LibGII README
=============

LibGII (General Input Interface) is intended to be to input what our LibGGI
(General Graphics Interface) library is to graphics.

The goal of LibGII is to provide a single easy to use, but yet powerful,
API for all possible input sources. However we are not there yet. The
API is far from set in stone yet, and is likely to change.

The main purpose of this LibGII release is to accompany our LibGGI beta
release, but you're still very welcome to use LibGII as a standalone
library for your non-LibGGI applications. Also you might be interrested in
the mhub utility found in the demos directory. mhub is a mouse event repeater
and converter. See mhub(1) and the files doc/env.txt and doc/input.txt for
more info.


How to install and use
======================

See the files INSTALL and INSTALL.autoconf for installation instructions.

Demos are found in the programs/demos sub directory.  They are built
automatically.
