iogen is an i/o generator.  It forks child processes that each run a mix of
reads and writes.  The idea is to generate heavily fragmented files to make the
hardware suffer as much as possible.  This tool has been used to test
filesystems, drivers, firmware and hardware devices.  It is by no means meant
as a performance measuring tool since it tries to recreate the worst case
scenario i/o.
