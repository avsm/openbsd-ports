To prevent errors, the "unclutter" program (from x11/unclutter) must not
be running when using gnome-mplayer.

MPlayer software volume control (softvol) is enabled by default because 
there is no volume control in mplayer's sndio backend.

With older (< 2.28.0) versions of the gconf2 package, be sure to kill 
any gconfd-2 daemon that may be running before starting gnome-mplayer 
for the first time.
