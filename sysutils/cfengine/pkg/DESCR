Cfengine, or the configuration engine, is an autonomous agent and a middle to 
high level policy language for building expert systems which administrate and 
configure large computer networks. Cfengine uses the idea of classes and a 
primitive intelligence to define and automate the configuration and 
maintenance of system state, for small to huge configurations.
