FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec.  Grossly oversimplified,
FLAC is similar to MP3, but lossless.  The FLAC project consists
of:

* The stream format.
* libFLAC, which implements a reference encoder, stream decoder,
  and file decoder.
* flac, which is a command-line wrapper around libFLAC to encode
  and decode .flac files.
