Leafpad is a simple GTK+ text editor that emphasizes simplicity. As
development focuses on keeping weight down to a minimum, only the most
essential features are implemented in the editor. Leafpad is simple to
use, is easily compiled, requires few libraries, and starts up quickly.

Currently Leafpad has the following features:

 * Codeset option (Some OpenI18N registered)
 * Auto codeset detection (UTF-8 and some codesets)
 * Unlimited Undo/Redo
 * Auto/Multi-line Indent
 * Display line numbers
 * Drag and Drop
 * Printing
