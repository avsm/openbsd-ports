PostgreSQL is Object-Relational Database Management System.  It
supports almost all SQL constructs, including transactions, subselects,
and user-defined types and functions. Write-ahead logging (new with
7.1) means increased performance while retaining data integrity.

The OpenBSD PostgreSQL port build produces several packages:

* postgresql-${VERSION} - complete package
  Contains all files needed for creating, administering and maintaining
  databases, quering and manipulating data in them, libraries and
  header files for database applications development and man pages

* postgresql-clients-${VERSION} - client-side applications and headers
  Reduced variant of complete package without backend-related files

* postgresql-docs-${VERSION} - documentation
  Additinal documentation: FAQs, READMEs; PostgreSQL manuals in
  HTML format: Administrator's Guide, Programmer's Manual, PostgreSQL
  Tutorial and User's Guide and Integrated Documentation package
  contains all the above documantation


Packages can be built with additional FLAVORs:

* tcl
  PostgreSQL built with TCL/TK interfaces.  Provides TCL/TK language
  interfaces to Postgres backends; includes pgaccess - Postgres
  graphical interactive client.  This FLAVOR requires lang/tcl/8.3
  and x11/tk/8.3 packages.
       
* odbc
  PostgreSQL built with ODBC (Open Data Base Connectivity) driver
  package You need to install some driver manager to use it. You
  can use iODBC (intrinsic Open Database Connectivity) driver manager

  tree.
