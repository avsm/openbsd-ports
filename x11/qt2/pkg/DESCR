Qt is a toolkit for building a GUI for X in C++. 
There are some user documentation files in ${QT_DOC}, but
the main documentation is in the qt2-html package, 
or on the web (${HOMEPAGE}).

There is also a qt2-examples package, that contains a tutorial and 
simple example programs (source + binaries).

Available flavor:
gl
	includes limited OpenGL support. Not actually required for kde2.
