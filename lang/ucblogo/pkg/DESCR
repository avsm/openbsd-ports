ucblogo is the Berkeley interpreter for the Logo programming language.

Special features of this dialect are:

- Random-access arrays.
- Variable number of inputs to user-defined procedures.
- Mutators for list structure (dangerous).
- Pause on error, and other improvements to error handling.
- Comments and continuation lines; formatting is preserved when
  procedure definitions are saved or edited.
- Terrapin-style tokenization (e.g., [2+3] is a list with one member)
  but LCSI-style syntax (no special forms except TO). The best of both worlds.
- First-class instruction and expression templates.
- Macros.
