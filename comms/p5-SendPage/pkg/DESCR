What is Sendpage?

To send alphanumeric pages to a pager, if an email gateway is
unavailable or undesirable, software is needed to control a modem
which will dial a "Paging Central", and deliver the pages using an
ASCII delivery system known as "TAP".

Sendpage implements all aspects of this type of software, including an
SNPP client, an SNPP server, a queuing engine, a modem control engine,
a TAP communication system, and an email notification system. Sendpage
is available under the GNU General Public License.
