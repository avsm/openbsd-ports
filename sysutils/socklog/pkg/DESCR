socklog, in cooperation with the runit package, is a small and secure
replacement for syslogd.  There are three main features syslogd provides:

* receiving syslog messages from an unix domain socket ("/dev/log") and
  writing them to various files on disk depending on facility and priority.
* receiving syslog messages from an udp socket ("0.0.0.0:514") and writing
  them to various files on disk depending on facility and priority.
* writing received syslog messages to an udp socket ("a.b.c.d:514")
