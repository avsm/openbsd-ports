The BIRD project aims to develop a fully functional dynamic IP
routing daemon primarily targeted on (but not limited to) UNIX-like
systems and distributed under the GNU General Public License.

    * Both IPv4 and IPv6
    * Multiple routing tables (not on OpenBSD yet)
    * BGP
    * RIP
    * OSPF (IPv4 only)
    * Static routes
    * Inter-table protocol
    * Command-line interface
    * Soft reconfiguration
    * Powerful language for route filtering

Due to bird's build system, packages are split: the bird package
contains IPv4 daemons, bird-v6 contains IPv6 daemons (build with
FLAVOR=v6), and bird-doc contains the manual.
