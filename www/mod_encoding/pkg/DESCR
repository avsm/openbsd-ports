This module improves non-ascii filename interoperability of Apache
(and mod_dav).

It seems many WebDAV clients send filename in its platform-local
encoding.  But since mod_dav expects everything, even HTTP request line,
to be in UTF-8, this causes an interoperability problem.

This module adds following directives:
EncodingEngine, SetServerEncoding, AddClientEncoding,
DefaultClientEncoding, and NormalizeUsername.
