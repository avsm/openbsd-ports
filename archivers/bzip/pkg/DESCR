Bzip  compresses  files  using the Burrows-Wheeler-Fenwick
block-sorting text compression algorithm.

Compression is generally considerably better than that achieved by
more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and competitive with
all but the best of the PPM family of statistical compressors.
