Libshout is a library for communicating with and sending data to an
icecast server. It handles the socket connection, the timing of the
data, and prevents bad data from getting to the icecast server.

With just a few lines of code, a programmer can easily turn any
application into a streaming source for an icecast server. Libshout
also allows developers who want a specific feature set (database
access, request taking) to concentrate on that feature set, instead of
worrying about how server communication works.

Please refer to the api reference and example code to start learning
how to use libshout in your own code. See
${PREFIX}/include/shout/shout.h and
${PREFIX}/share/examples/libshout/example.c
for details.
