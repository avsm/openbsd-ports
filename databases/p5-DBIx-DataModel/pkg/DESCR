DBIx::DataModel is a wrapper framework for building Perl abstractions
(classes, objects and datastructures) that interact with relational
database management systems (RDBMS).  Of course the ubiquitous DBI
module is used as a basic layer for communicating with databases; on
top of that, DBIx::DataModel provides facilities for generating SQL
queries, joining tables automatically, navigating through the results,
converting values, and building complex datastructures so that other
modules can conveniently exploit the data.
