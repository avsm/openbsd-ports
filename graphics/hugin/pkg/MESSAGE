You may optionally install autopano-sift-C to automatically detect
similar image features and generate control points. As autopano-sift-C
uses the SIFT algorithm, which is patented in the USA, this is not
automatically installed as a dependency.

Either "pkg_add autopano-sift-c" or select your control points manually.
