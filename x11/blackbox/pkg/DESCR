Blackbox is yet another addition to the list of window managers for the
X Consortium's X Windowing System Version 11 Release 6. Blackbox is built
with C++, sharing no common code with any other window manager (even though
the graphics implementation is similar to that of WindowMaker). It features
small code size, a fast interface with simple menus, multiple workspaces,
and decorated windows , built-in graphics code to render solids, gradients
and bevels on the fly when needed, and more.
