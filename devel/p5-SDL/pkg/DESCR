SDL_perl is a package of perl modules that provides both functional
and object orient interfaces to the Simple DirectMedia Layer for Perl
5. This package does take some liberties with the SDL API, and
attempts to adhere to the spirit of both the SDL and Perl. For the
object oriented programming interface please see the documentation
provided on a per class basis.
