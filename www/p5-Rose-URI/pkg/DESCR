An URI class allowing easy and efficient manipulation of query
parameters and other URI components.

    use Rose::URI;

    $uri = Rose::URI->new('http://un:pw@foo.com/bar/baz?a=1&b=two+3');

    $scheme = $uri->scheme;
    $user   = $uri->username;
    $pass   = $uri->password;
    $host   = $uri->host;
    $path   = $uri->path;

Rose::URI is an alternative to URI.  The important differences are
as follows.

Rose::URI provides a rich set of query string manipulation methods.
Query parameters can be added, removed, and checked for their
existence. URI allows the entire query to be set or returned as a
whole via the query_form|URI/query_form> or L<query|URI/query
methods, and the URI::QueryParam module provides a few more methods
for query string manipulation.

Rose::URI supports query parameters with multiple values (e.g.
"a=1&a=2"). URI has  limited support for this (through
query_form|URI/query_form's list return value.  Better methods are
available in URI::QueryParam.

Rose::URI uses Apache's C-based URI parsing and HTML escaping
functions when running in a mod_perl 1.x web server environment.
