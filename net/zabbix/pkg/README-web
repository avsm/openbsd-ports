The Zabbix web frontend has been installed into
${PREFIX-web}/zabbix

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
    # ln -s ../zabbix /var/www/htdocs/zabbix
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

zabbix-web frontend can use a PostgreSQL, MySQL or SQLite3 database.
Install the php5-pgsql, php5-mysql or php5-pdo_sqlite package according
to the one you wish to use.

The web frontend works reasonably well with OpenBSD's chroot'ed
httpd (the "Status of Zabbix" page uses /bin/ps and /dev/kmem to
check the process, so it erroneously reports it as not running).
Some changes from the default configuration are required -
you can do this by creating symbolic links as follows:

# ln -s ${PREFIX-web}/conf/modules.sample/zabbix.conf \
        ${PREFIX-web}/conf/modules

# ln -fs ${PREFIX-web}/conf/php5.sample/zabbix.ini \
        ${PREFIX-web}/conf/php5/zabbix.ini

Zabbix requires a timezone to be configured in PHP; zabbix.ini
sets this to UTC, you may like to adjust this. After making these
changes, stop and start httpd.
