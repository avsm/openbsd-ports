Because FAM uses RPC, please make sure that the RPC port mapper is
enabled by checking whether portmap=YES is in /etc/rc.conf.local.  After
that, restart the portmap(8) server.

Furthermore, you have to enable the FAM daemon.  There are two ways to do
this: through inetd(8) or as a standalone server.  If you prefer the former
way, add the following line to /etc/inetd.conf:

sgi_fam/1-2     stream  rpc/tcp wait    root    ${PREFIX}/sbin/famd famd

and reload inetd(8) daemon.  To enable the FAM daemon as a standalone
server add the following lines to /etc/rc.local file:

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/famd ]; then
	${PREFIX}/sbin/famd -T 0
fi
