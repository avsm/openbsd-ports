Example config files for Courier-IMAP have been installed in
${PREFIX}/share/examples/courier-imap and copied also to
${SYSCONFDIR}/courier-imap, edit them to your site's needs.

Pay particular attention to the details in imapd.cnf, and read ssl(8) if
necessary. You MUST set the CN in imapd.cnf to the hostname by which
your IMAP server is accessed, or else clients will complain. When this
is done, you can use the 'mkimapdcert' script to automatically generate
a server certificate, which is installed into /etc/ssl/private/imapd.pem

To control the daemon use ${PREFIX}/libexec/imapd.rc and
${PREFIX}/libexec/imapd-ssl.rc, and to run the authdaemon, place the
following in /etc/rc.local:

mkdir -p ${COURIERSTATE}
${PREFIX}/sbin/authdaemond start
