Empathy is able to use several Telepathy connection managers.
By default the following managers are installed:

  * MSN 		(Butterfly)
  * Jabber 		(Gabble)
  * Zeroconf/Bonjour	(Salut)
  * IRC			(Idle)

It is also possible to use the protocols supported by Pidgin's Purple
(SILC, Facebook, etc) by installing the Haze connection manager
(telepathy-haze).
