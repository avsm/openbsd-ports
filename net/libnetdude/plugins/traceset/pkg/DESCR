The Trace Set plugin provides an abstraction for a set of inut traces.
These traces can be opened trace files, filenames, or files containing a
list of file names. The API provides a way to iterate over these traces,
providing the opened trace file as an LND_Trace * to the callback. Many
plugins want to operate on a number of traces; this plugin provides the
right data structures for this purpose.
