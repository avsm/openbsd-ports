WMnet polls network statistics and does a few things with the data it gets.

It has small blinking lights for the rx and tx of IP packets, a digital
speedometer of your polled stat's current speed and a bar graph like xload
et. al which has a tx speed graph from bottom-up and rx speed graph from
the top-down.

The speedometer keeps track of the current speed per second and shows it
in a color corresponding to which of rx or tx that has the highest speed
at the moment.  Also, the graph is drawn in a way that the highest speed
is drawn on top of the other while the other is in the background.
