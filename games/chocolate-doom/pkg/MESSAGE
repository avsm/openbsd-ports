To play the game you will need an original Doom, Ultimate Doom, Doom II
or Final Doom IWAD. Place the doom.wad, doom2.wad, plutonia.wad,
tnt.wad, or all of the above in ${PREFIX}/share/games/doom/ to play.
If multiple IWADs are installed, you may specify the one you want to
play via the -iwad command-line parameter e.g.

  $ chocolate-doom -iwad doom.wad

The Shareware IWAD is available in games/doomdata.

Run `chocolate-setup' to generate a configuration file to your liking.
If you would like to enjoy the classic in-game Doom music, you may
install audio/timidity and Chocolate Doom will automatically make use
of it at runtime, no recompilation required. Be sure that the music is
enabled within chocolate-setup.
