archivemail is a tool written in python(1) for archiving and compressing
old email in mailboxes. By default it will read the mailbox MAILBOX,
moving messages that are older that the specified number of days (180 by
default) to a mbox-format mailbox in the same directory that is
compressed with gzip(1). archivemail supports reading IMAP, Maildir, MH
and mbox-format  mailboxes, but it  will always write archive files to
mbox-format mailboxes that are compressed with gzip(1)
