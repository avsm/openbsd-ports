This is a port to C from a version of Starlanes for the Osborne 1.  The
original source is from a First Osborne Group (FOG) disk that I probably
picked up in 1982.  The author isn't identified.  Based on comments in
a TRS-80 version I picked up off the web, it would appear that it was
first published in Creative Computing magazine.
