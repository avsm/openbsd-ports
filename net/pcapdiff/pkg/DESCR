Pcapdiff is a tool developed by the EFF to compare two packet captures
and identify potentially forged, dropped, or mangled packets.

Two technically-inclined friends can set up packet captures on their
own computers and produce network traffic between their two computers
over the Internet.

Later, they can run pcapdiff on the two packet capture files to
identify suspicious packets for further investigation.
