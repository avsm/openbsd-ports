Fluxbox is yet another window manager for X. It's based on the
original Blackbox 0.61.1 code. Fluxbox looks like Blackbox and
handles styles, colors, window placement and similar thing exactly
like Blackbox (100% theme/style compability).

So what's the difference between Fluxbox and Blackbox then? The
answer is: LOTS!

Here is a list of features that have been added to Fluxbox:

 * New native integrated keygrabber (supports emacs like keychains)
 * Wheel scroll changes workspace
 * pwm-like window tabs
 * Iconbar (for minimized/iconified windows)
 * Configurable titlebar (placement of buttons, new buttons, etc)
 * Maximize over slit option
 * Slit dockapp ordering
 * KDE 3 support
 * GNOME 2 support
 * Extended window manager hints support
 * AntiAliased font support
 * UTF-8 support
 * Lots of other minor features
