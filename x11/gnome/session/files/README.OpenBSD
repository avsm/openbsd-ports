The OpenBSD/GNOME desktop

The gnome-session package will install a minimal working GNOME desktop.
It provides you with the basic interface (including themes), a control
panel, a terminal, a text editor and a lot more other utilities.

This file will briefly explain to you how to make this experience more
pleasant.

you'll need to install the libgail-gnome package which adds ATK
interfaces for libbonoboui and libgnomeui widgets.
