Ezstream is a command line utility which allows streaming media files to
an Icecast server. By default, ezstream does not do any reencoding by
itself and thus requires very little CPU. Through the use of external
en- and decoders, virtually any format can be streamed.

Ezstream can also read from stdin. ID3v1 tags are supported in MP3 files
and all Ogg Vorbis tags are propagated as metadata as well.
