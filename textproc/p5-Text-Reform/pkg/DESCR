The form() subroutine may be exported from the module. It takes a series
of format (or "picture") strings followed by replacement values,
interpolates those values into each picture string, and returns the
result. The effect is similar to the inbuilt perl format mechanism,
although the field specification syntax is simpler and some of the
formatting behaviour is more sophisticated.
