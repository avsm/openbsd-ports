Blatte is a very powerful text markup and transformation language
with a very simple syntax.  A Blatte document can be translated
into a Perl program that, when executed, produces a transformed
version of the input document.

Most casual end users will probably be interested in Blatte's ability
to serve as a higher-level language for writing web pages.  This
requires the additional CPAN package Blatte::HTML, which is also
available as an OpenBSD port that can be found in www/p5-Blatte-HTML.
