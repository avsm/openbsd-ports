Chora is a tool for viewing code repositories that are managed
using the CVS or Subversion source control systems. It aims to
provide a high degree of integration with CVS, SVN and the other
Horde web-based tools.

To complete the installation, be sure that Horde is configured and
working first, then see ${PREFIX}/${INSTDIR}/docs/INSTALL

If using the default OpenBSD configuration of httpd, you will need to
copy tools and libraries into the chroot jail. The following are enough
for cvs; see "Paths and Locations" in Chora's setup menu for optional
extras and other version control systems.

# mkdir -p /var/www/bin; cp /bin/sh /var/www/bin
# cd /usr/bin; sh /var/www/horde/chora/copywithlibs.sh \
    ci co rcs rcsdiff rlog cvs diff
