An installer created by the InstallShield software stores the files it
will install inside of InstallShield Cabinet Files. It would thus be
desirable to be able to extract the Microsoft Cabinet Files from the
InstallShield Cabinet Files in order to be able to install the
applications without access to Microsoft Windows. Unshield supports
InstallShield versions 5 and later.
