mon is a tool for monitoring the availability of services and sending alerts 
on prescribed events.

This is a small howto to get mon running in a basic setup.

 1. Edit ${SYSCONFDIR}/mon/mon.cf to fit your needs.
 
 2. You may need additional perl modules in order to use some monitors.
    Check your monitor file with perl -c.
    Example: perl -c ${TRUEPREFIX}/lib/mon/mon.d/dns.monitor

 3. Launch mon in debug mode:
    /usr/bin/install -d -o _mon /var/run/mon
    su -l _mon -c "${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/mon -c /etc/mon/mon.cf -d -P /var/run/mon/mon.pid"

 4. When everything is ok, launch mon as a daemon:
    ${SYSCONFDIR}/rc.d/mon start

 Random hints:

 * To use fping.monitor you must install fping.
 
 * If you need a graphical interface, please install mon-client which contains 
   a simple cgi.
