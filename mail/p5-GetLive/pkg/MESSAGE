Refer to ${PREFIX}/share/doc/GetLive/Manual for configuration file
options.

To use GetLive with SMTP as a delivery mechanism, see the scripts in
${PREFIX}/share/examples/GetLive.

GetLive has been patched to deal with Hotmail changes.  Log into Hotmail
through a browser and check the box so it never shows the 'changed' page
again.  Then, add 'Mode=200810' to your config file.  You may also have
to turn off 'reading panes'.
