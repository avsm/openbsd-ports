VMware is a proprietary/commercial x86 machine emulator.
Only a small part of the code base was made available, but it
was enough to get this port working on OpenBSD.
However, Version 3 is past its End Of Life with the supplier,
so you cannot buy licenses for it from vmware.com (dont even ask
them or the port maintainer).

You MUST have to either have a VMware V3 license already, or find one on
eBay or elsewhere, before you can use this product.

You should also consider the non-proprietary emulators such as
qemu and bochs (which are in ports) among others.
