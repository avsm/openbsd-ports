Ethos is a library that provides a consistent plugin interface for
application extenders to target.  The more applications that use ethos
for plugins, the faster the community can expand to provide new features
to new projects.

The core ethos library, libethos-1.0, only links against libgobject so
that it is safe to use in GUI-less applications.  The GTK+ library,
libethos-ui-1.0, provides widgets that can be embedded within your
application to manage plugins during run-time.
