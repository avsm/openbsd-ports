from antirez's INSTALL docs:

        WARNING: hping2 isn't so trusted code, i didn't
        audit for hidden buffers over flow and others
        security related problems. However if (as default)
        LIMITWHENSUID is defined if euid != uid
        it's not possible to use a lot of options
        banally unsafe.
