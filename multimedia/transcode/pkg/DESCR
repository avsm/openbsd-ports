transcode is a text console video-stream processing tool. 
It supports elementary video and audio frame transformations. 
Some example modules are included to enable import of MPEG-1/2, 
Digital Video, and other formats. It also includes export 
modules for writing to AVI files with DivX, OpenDivX, XviD,
Digital Video or other codecs. Direct DVD transcoding is also 
supported. A set of tools is available to extract and decode 
the sources into raw video/audio streams for import and to 
enable post-processing of AVI files.

There are a few FLAVORS that add functionality to transcode:

    lzo: adds the ability to import and export AVI files
        that use LZO compression for video.
    mjpegtools: adds video encoding with mpeg2enc and audio
        encoding with mp2enc from the mjpegtools package.
        also adds the ability to import YUV4MPEG streams.
    quicktime: adds the ability to import and export using
        the libquicktime API, thus it adds the ability to
        import and export QuickTime-compatible .mov files.
