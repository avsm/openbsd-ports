PyXMPP is a Python XMPP (RFC 3920,3921) and Jabber implementation. It is
based on libxml2 -- fast and fully-featured XML parser.

PyXMPP provides most core features of the XMPP protocol and several
JSF-defined extensions. PyXMPP provides building blocks for creating
Jabber clients and components. Developer uses them to setup XMPP
streams, handle incoming events and create outgoing stanzas (XMPP
"packets").
