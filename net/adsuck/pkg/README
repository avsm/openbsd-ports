Running adsuck(1) locally with dhclient(8)
==========================================

To make dhclient(8) play nice with adsuck(1), the following script has
been installed:

    ${TRUEPREFIX}/sbin/dhclient-adsuck

Provided that adsuck(1) is installed and adsuck_flags is not set to "NO"
in rc.conf.local(5), this script will prevent from using
/etc/resolv.conf to resolve non-blacklisted entries but use
/var/adsuck/files/resolv.conf instead.
For a proper use you need to add this line to /etc/dhclient.conf:

    script "${PREFIX}/sbin/dhclient-adsuck";

Make sure that /etc/resolv.conf only contains:

    nameserver 127.0.0.1
