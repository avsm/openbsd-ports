Blender is an integrated suite of tools enabling the creation of a
broad range of 3D content. It offers full functionality for modelling,
rendering, animation, post-production, creation and playback of
interactive 3D content with the benefit of cross-platform operability.
Aimed at media professionals and artists, Blender can be used to create
3D visualizations, stills as well as broadcast quality video.
