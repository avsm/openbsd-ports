To start the TrueType font server for X11 at boot time, put something like 
the following in /etc/rc.local:

if [ -x /usr/X11R6/bin/xfstt ]; then
	echo -n ' xfstt';	/usr/X11R6/bin/xfstt &
fi

You should also add the following to your FontPath in /etc/XF86Config:

FontPath "unix/:7100"

You should also put some TrueType fonts in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType.
Additional documentation can be found in /usr/X11R6/share/doc/xfstt.
