A declarative layer on top of SQLAlchemy. It is a fairly thin
wrapper, which provides the ability to create simple Python classes
that map directly to relational database tables (this pattern is
often referred to as the Active Record design pattern), providing
many of the benefits of traditional databases without losing the
convenience of Python objects.
