Yet another network load monitor. Slurm started as a port of a Linux
PPP link monitor called pppstatus by Gabriel Montenegro. It was then
transformed into a generic network load monitor that supports *BSD,
Linux, HP-UX, and Solaris.

Slurm shows `realtime' traffic statistics, has three graph modes,
can monitor any network device, and uses curses to draw ascii
graphics, including ascii theme support.
