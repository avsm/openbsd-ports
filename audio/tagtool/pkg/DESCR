Audio Tag Tool is a program to manage the information fields in MP3 and
Ogg Vorbis files, commonly called tags. Tag Tool can be used to edit
tags one by one, but the most useful features are the ability to easily
tag or rename hundreds of files at once, in any desired format. The mass
tag and mass rename features can handle filenames in any format thanks
to an easily configurable format template.
