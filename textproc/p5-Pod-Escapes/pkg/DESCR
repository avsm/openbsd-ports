This module provides things that are useful in decoding Pod E<...>
sequences. It is intended to be used by Pod parsers and/or formatters.

By default, Pod::Escapes exports none of its symbols. But you can
request any of them to be exported. Either request them individually,
as with use Pod::Escapes qw(symbolname symbolname2...);, or you can
do use Pod::Escapes qw(:ALL); to get all exportable symbols.
