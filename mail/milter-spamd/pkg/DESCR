milter-spamd is a sendmail milter plugin that passes mails through
SpamAssassin's spamd, rejecting mails inline that are considered
spam.

In order to build milter-spamd, sendmail needs to be compiled with
milter support, installing the libmilter library:

	# cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.sbin/sendmail
	# make clean cleandir
	# [set the environment variable WANT_LIBMILTER to 1]
	# make obj && make && make install
