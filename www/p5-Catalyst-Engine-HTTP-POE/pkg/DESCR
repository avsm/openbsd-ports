This engine allows Catalyst to process multiple requests in parallel
within a single process. Much of the internal Catalyst flow now uses POE
yield calls. Application code will still block of course, but all I/O,
header processing, and POST body processing is handled asynchronously.

This engine should still be considered experimental and likely has bugs,
however as it's only intended for development, please use it and report
bugs.
