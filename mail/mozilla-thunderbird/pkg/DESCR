Mozilla Thunderbird is a redesign of the Mozilla mail component.
Our goal is to produce a cross platform stand alone mail application
using the XUL user interface language. Our intended customer is
someone who uses Mozilla Firebird (or another stand alone browser)
as their primary browser and wants a mail client based on mozilla
that "plays nice" with the browser.
