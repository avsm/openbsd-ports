UFRaw is a utility to read and manipulate raw images from digital
cameras. It can be used by itself or as a GIMP plug-in.

It reads raw images using an internal copy of Dave Coffin's raw
conversion utility DCRaw and supports basic color management using
Little CMS, allowing the user to apply color profiles.

The optional lensfun flavor allows use of the lensfun library to
correct for distortion, transversal chromatic aberrations, vignetting
and colour contribution of the lens.
