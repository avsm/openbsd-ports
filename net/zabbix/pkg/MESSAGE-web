The Zabbix web frontend has been installed into
${PREFIX-web}/zabbix

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
    # ln -s ../zabbix /var/www/htdocs/zabbix
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

zabbix-web frontend can use a PostgreSQL or MySQL database.  Install the
php5-pgsql or php5-mysql package according to the one you wish to use.
