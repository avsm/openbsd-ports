In order to update /etc/services and /etc/inetd.conf, run

   ${PREFIX}/libexec/amanda/patch-system --disable-index --disable-tape

You should check both of these files, verifying proper installation.
Once verified issue the command:

   kill -HUP `cat /var/run/inetd.pid`

You also need to create /operator/.amandahosts, which will contain the
FQDN of the tape server and the user allowed to access this machine.
The contents should look like this:

   backup.openbsd.org operator

The permissions of /operator/.amandahosts must be restricted:

   chmod u=rw /operator/.amandahosts
   chown operator:operator /operator/.amandahosts

Sample configuration files have been installed in
${PREFIX}/share/examples/amanda.


gpg flavor only:

You need an additional secret GPG key for the backup user on the
client. There is one drawback in this configuration, the key must be
setup without a password. After key generation import the master public
key:

   gpg --import /tmp/master-pub.key

The imported key needs to be signed otherwise gnupg will not run
properly in batch mode:

   gpg --sign-key $MASTER-PUBKEY-ID

Add the following variables to ${SYSCONFDIR}/amanda/amanda.gpg.conf:

   gpg_home="/operator/.gnupg"	# keyring location
   gpg_id="$MASTER-PUBKEY-ID"	# pub key id of master key
