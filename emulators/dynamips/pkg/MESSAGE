By default, a dynamips instance will take 100% of the host CPU. To
avoid this, please read the "idle-pc" section in the README file
(${PREFIX}/share/doc/dynamips/README). The configuration generator
"dynagen" (available separately) can help find a good value.

You can greatly reduce startup times by uncompressing your IOS
images with unzip.

N.B. The just-in-time compiler, required for good performance,
is currently only supported on i386 and amd64.
