Enblend combines images that partially overlap into a single large
image with no seams (panorama generation). This is a command-line
tool which performs the actual composition; another tool is required
to line up the images ready for input (e.g. Hugin).

Enfuse combines images that overlap into a single image with good
focus and exposure (exposure stacking for high dynamic range, focus
stacking for extended depth-of-field).
