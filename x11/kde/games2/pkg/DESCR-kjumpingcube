KJumpingCube is a simple tactical game. You can play it against the
computer or against a friend. The playing field consists of squares that
contains points. By clicking on the squares you can increase the points,
and if the points reach a maximum the points will jump to the squares
neighbours and take them over. Winner is the one, who owns all squares.
