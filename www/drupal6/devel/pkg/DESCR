Devel can slow down a drupal site by a great amount, but allows you to
debug database queries/node grants to obtain the results you need.

Activate the modules, then add the blocks where you want them, and make
sure the roles have the correct permissions.

Do not use on production sites, for obvious reasons...

PLEASE NOTE: devel_themer is incompatible with dhtml_menu !!!!
DO NOT activate them both at once.
