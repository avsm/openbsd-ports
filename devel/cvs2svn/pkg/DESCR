cvs2svn is a tool to migrate as much information as possible from
an existing CVS repository on a local filesystem to a new Subversion
or GIT repository.

It is able to infer information about changesets by looking at
which files were committed together and attempts to reconstruct as
much of your CVS repository's history as possible.

Intermediate data is stored to on-disk databases so that cvs2svn
can convert very large CVS repositories using a reasonable amount
of RAM. Conversions are organized as multiple passes and can be
restarted at an arbitrary pass in the case of problems.
