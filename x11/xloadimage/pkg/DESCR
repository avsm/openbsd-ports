This utility will view several types of images under X11, or load
images onto the root window.  The current version supports:

	CMU Window Manager raster files
	Faces Project images
	Fuzzy Bitmap (FBM) images
	GEM bit images
	GIF images
	G3 FAX images
	JFIF-style JPEG images
	McIDAS areafiles
	MacPaint images
	PC Paintbrush (PCX) images
	Portable Bitmap (PBM, PGM, PPM) images
	Sun monochrome rasterfiles
	Sun color RGB rasterfiles
	Utah Raster Toolkit (RLE) files
	X pixmap files
	X10 bitmap files
	X11 bitmap files
	X Window Dump (except XYPixmap, TrueColor and DirectColor)

A variety of options are available to modify images prior to viewing.
These options include clipping, dithering, depth reduction, zoom
(either X or Y axis independently or both at once), brightening or
darkening, and image merging.  When applicable, these options are done
automatically (eg a color image to be displayed on a monochrome screen
will be dithered automatically).
