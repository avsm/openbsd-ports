PyProtocols extends the PEP 246 adapt() function with a new
"declaration API" that lets you easily define your own protocols
and adapters, and declare what adapters should be used to adapt
what types, objects, or protocols.  In addition to its own Interface
type, PyProtocols can also use Twisted and Zope's Interface types.
