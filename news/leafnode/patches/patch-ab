 9. Edit /etc/inetd.conf so that $(BINDIR)/leafnode is executed for incoming
    NNTP connections.  Here is my inetd.conf line:
 
-nntp    stream  tcp     nowait  news    /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/sbin/leafnode
+nntp    stream  tcp     nowait  news    /usr/libexec/tcpd /usr/local/sbin/leafnode
 
    This starts leafnode for all connections on the nntp port, subject to
-   /etc/hosts/allow and /etc/hosts.deny screening.  If you don't have
-   /usr/sbin/tcpd you might use this line instead:
+   /etc/hosts/allow and /etc/hosts.deny screening.  If you don't want to use
+   /usr/libexec/tcpd you might use this line instead:
