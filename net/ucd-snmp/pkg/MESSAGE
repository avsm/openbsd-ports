+------------
| By default, the configuration files and mib modules for snmpd are in stored 
| in /usr/local/share/snmp.  An example configuration has been installed in
| /usr/local/share/examples/ucd-snmp/EXAMPLE.conf.  Extra documentation has
| also been installed in /usr/local/share/doc/ucd-snmp.
|
| To have snmpd start at boot time, you must have an entry similiar to the 
| following in /etc/rc.local.
|
| 	if [ -x /usr/local/sbin/snmpd ]; then
|		/usr/local/sbin/snmpd -c /etc/snmpd.conf && echo -n ' snmpd'
|	fi
|
| This will start snmpd and use /etc/snmpd.conf for the configuration. 
| (see snmpd(5) for available options)
