For people upgrading from sawfish 1.7.1 or older, you will have to
manually migrate your existing configuration:

Infinite-desktop and edge-flip needs updates.

Open the configurator -> "Edge Actions". Changes will be
easy. (Set 4 pull-downs, and you're done mostly.
"Infinite-desktop" is renamed to "viewport-drag".) For more
options, see "Edge Actions" below.

If your `~/.sawfish/rc' opens related modules, delete those
references.  These modules are renamed, and you don't have to
manually load them any more.

And restart sawfish.
