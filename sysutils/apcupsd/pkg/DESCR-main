Apcupsd can be used for power mangement and controlling most of APC's
UPS models. Apcupsd works with most of APC's Smart-UPS models as well as
most simple signalling models such a Back-UPS, and BackUPS-Office.
During a power failure, apcupsd will inform the users about the power
failure and that a shutdown may occur. If power is not restored, a
system shutdown will follow when the battery is exhausted, a timeout
(seconds) expires, or runtime expires based on internal APC calculations
determined by power consumption rates.
