| For using anonymous remailers, up-to-date public key rings are a necessity.
| You should fetch these at least daily and provide them to your users.
| ${PREFIX}/share/examples/mixmaster/mixmaster-update.pl is a sample
| script facilitating this task.
|
| All users have their own mixmaster configuration files and pools in
| ~/.Mix, but global defaults can be specified in
| ${SYSCONFDIR}/mixmaster/client.cfg. You might want to specify PUBRING and
| TYPE2REL in this file to point to some sitewide files fetched, e.g. by the
| above mentioned script.
