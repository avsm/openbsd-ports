This features:

* amor - a neko-like clone, with cute characters that sit on your windows
borders (apparently only works with a kde desktop).
* kodo - a mouse odometer.
* kteatime - timer to prepare tea.
* kmoon - phases of the moon-type program.
* ktimewatch - display of night on earth.

Mostly completely useless.
