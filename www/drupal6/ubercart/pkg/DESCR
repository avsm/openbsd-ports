Ubercart is an e-commerce suite developed for Drupal. It has been
designed with the end user in mind, focusing on usability in three key
areas: store configuration, product and catalog creation, and order
administration. On the front end, all major systems are configurable and
integrate with the standard Drupal systems (node, taxonomy, user, etc.).
On the back end, the settings pages and order administration pages have
been designed with ease of use in mind.
