This library collects together existing Haskell cryptographic
functions and augments them so that they:
	+ Have common type signatures.
	+ Can be used with the standard mode and padding algorithms
         (in the case of block mode ciphers).

This release contains:
	+ DES, Blowfish, Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, PKCS5 and
	  nulls padding, SHA-1, MD5, RSA, OAEP, ASN.1, PKCS#8
