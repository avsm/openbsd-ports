flowd is a NetFlow collector daemon intended to be small, fast and 
secure. It features some basic filtering to limit or tag the flows that 
are recorded and is privilege separated, to limit security exposure from 
bugs in flowd itself. Flowd is IPv6 capable - supporting flow export via 
IPv6 transport and NetFlow v.9 IPv6 flow records. It also supports 
reception of flow datagrams sent to multicast groups, allowing one to 
build redundant flow gathering systems.
