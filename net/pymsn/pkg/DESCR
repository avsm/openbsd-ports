pymsn is a rewrite of libivy (http://hybrid.tuxfamily.org/ivy), during
this rewrite the usage of Python asyncore and asynchat were dropped in
favor of the pymsn.gio library based on Glib GIOChannel. This change
enabled easy integration with the Glib main loop.

pymsn also gained msnp2p support for display pictures and custom smileys
as well a Http Polling transport and proxy support.
