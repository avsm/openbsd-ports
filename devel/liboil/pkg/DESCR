Liboil is a library of simple functions that are optimized for various
CPUs.  These functions are generally loops implementing simple
algorithms, such as converting an array of N integers to floating-point
numbers or multiplying and summing an array of N numbers.  Clearly such
functions are candidates for significant optimization using various
techniques, especially by using extended instructions provided by modern
CPUs (Altivec, MMX, SSE, etc.).
