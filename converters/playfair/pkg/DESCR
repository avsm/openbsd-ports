The playfair program is quite simple.  It takes one of the iTMS
Protected AAC Audio Files, decodes it using a key obtained from your
iPod or Microsoft Windows system and then writes the new, decoded
version to disk as a regular AAC Audio File.  It then optionally copies
the metadata tags that describe the song, including the cover art, to
the new file.

playfair expects keys to be stored in the ~/.drms directory.
