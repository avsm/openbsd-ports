These tools are intended to simplify the tasks of configuring a Unix
system for workstations. They are not intended for configuring Unix
servers.

Configuring different Unix systems is different; every Unix system has
different ways of being administrated. The GNOME System Tools aspire to
unify these systems.

Each one of the GNOME System Tools is split in two parts: a backend
(which is typically written in Perl) and a user interface frontend
(which is typically written in C or Python).

The backend probes your system and parses the existing system files.
When the user has finished editing the system settings, the
configuration is written back as patches to the system files.

This means that the GNOME System Tools use whatever configuration files
are available on your system, and you can still edit those files by hand
or with other configuration tools without conflicts or data loss.
