html2text is a command line utility, written in C++, that converts HTML
documents into plain text.

Each HTML document is loaded from a location indicated by a URI or read
from standard input, and formatted into a stream of plain text
characters that is written to standard output or into an output-file.
The input-URI may specify a remote site, from that the documents are
loaded via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
