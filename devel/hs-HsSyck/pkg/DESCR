This is a simple YAML ('Yet Another Markup Language') processor,
used by the Pugs project for handling data serialization; this can
be useful for optimization and caching purposes.

This is an interface to the syck C library for parsing and dumping
YAML data. It lets you transform textual YAML data into an object
of type 'YamlNode', and vice versa, fast.
