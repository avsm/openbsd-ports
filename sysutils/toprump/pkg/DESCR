toprump is a modified version of the top(1) command included with
OpenBSD. Additional features include the ability to: view metrics using
an ASCII graph, highlight all the processes of a single user, filter
processes via an inverse username filter. Plus other modifications. The
OpenBSD top(1) command line and interactive options are unchanged.
