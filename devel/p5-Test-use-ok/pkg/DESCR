According to the Test::More documentation, it is recommended to run
"use_ok()" inside a "BEGIN" block, so functions are exported at
compile-time and prototypes are properly honored.

With this module, simply change all "use_ok" in test scripts to "use
ok", and they will be executed at "BEGIN" time. The explicit space after
"use" makes it clear that this is a single compile-time action.
