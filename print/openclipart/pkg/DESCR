The clipart library is a huge collection of freely reusable artwork.

The project asks all contributions to be placed in the public domain,
so that they can be freely reused, with no strings attached.

Most of the artwork  is in svg format.

Examples of svg viewers include svgdisplay, as part of the kdegraphics
package.
