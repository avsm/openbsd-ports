| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional Dependencies
=======================

If you need to assemble x86/amd64 asm then you should install nasm
(devel/nasm), although this is not essential to the use of radare2.

NOTE: nasm is not available for all architectures on OpenBSD.

Bindings
========

For now, we have only enabled the Vala bindings (as the radare-bindings2
package). Further languages may be enabled in the future.

Known Issues
============

Backtraces
----------

The 'dbt' command (debug backtrace) is broken.

Arches
------

Some arches have been disabled. Eg. powerpc:

02:03 <sthen_p> needs more work on powerpc ;)
02:03 <sthen_p> $ r2 /bin/ls
02:03 <sthen_p> Cannot use 'unknown' anal plugin.
02:03 <sthen_p> asm.arch: cannot find (unknown)
02:03 <sthen_p> Cannot use 'unknown' anal plugin.
02:03 <sthen_p> r_syscall_setup: Unknown os/arch 'openbsd'/'unknown'
