This is a package designed to teach the Tcl programming language in a
quick and easy manner.  The goal is to teach the minimal amount of Tcl
syntax, commands and options that are necessary to write useful
programs.

You are encouraged to use the man pages and books to augment this
tutorial.

This version covers all of the commands in the Tcl language, as of
version 7.4, and most of the commands added in later Tcl revisions.
