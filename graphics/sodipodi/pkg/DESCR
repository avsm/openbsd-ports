Sodipodi is (or at least should be) a vector illustrator program for
the GNOME environment.  It is currently in active development and
approaching general usability.

If you are more interested in hacking, you can also try out
KIllustrator, Gill and sketch. Sodipodi eagerly borrows code from
every other free program under the Sun (hey - isn't it the main point
about free software?)

You can always find the freshest sodipodi at GNOME CVS.  The official
homepage is ${HOMEPAGE} You can also find links
to the binary & source code packages there.
