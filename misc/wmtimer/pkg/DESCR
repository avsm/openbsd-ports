WMTimer is a dockable alarm clock for WindowMaker which can
be run in alarm, countdown timer, or chronograph mode.  In
alarm or timer mode, you can either execute a command or
sound the system bell when the time is reached.  Wmtimer is
configurable through the command line or the GTK GUI.

The "gold" flavor provides an alternative appearance.

WMTimer can be configured either at run time via the command
line or the GTK interface by clicking on the main part of the
window (anywhere except the buttons).

To switch to the chrono function simply click on the right
arrow button to start the chronograph.  You can pause the
chronogaph by clicking on the center, rectangle button and
resume again by clicking the right arrow button.  You can
reset the timer by clicking on the left arrow button.

Time entered via the command line must be in the form of x:x:x  
You dont need to have 2 digits for each number but you must
have at least zero's in as placeholders for hrs, mins and secs.
