Fvwm is a window manager for X, which provides a virtual/multiple
disjoint desktop, a 3D look for windows decorations, shaped/color
icons. It gives a very good emulation of mwm. A nice button-bar
can be used to provide convenient access to frequently used
functions or programs.

Comes with a set of icons.

Packages can be built with additional FLAVORs:

 rplay:	build with audio/rplay and provide sound support
	This FLAVOR requires the rplay package.

 debug:	turn on debugging messages

 i18n:	enable experimental multibyte character support
