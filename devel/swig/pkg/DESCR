SWIG is a tool for automatically generating the wrapper code needed
to link collections of functions written in C/C++ with interpreted
scripting languages.    Currently, SWIG supports :

        - Tcl
        - Perl4
        - Perl5
        - Guile-iii
        - Python 1.3
        - Ruby

Using SWIG, it is possible to greatly simplify interface development
and to put interesting interfaces on existing applications with
little effort.
