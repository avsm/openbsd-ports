SNMP::Info gives an object oriented interface to information obtained
through SNMP. This module is geared towards network devices.  Subclasses
exist for a number of network devices and common MIBs. The idea behind
this module is to give a common interface to data from network devices,
leaving the device-specific hacks behind the scenes in subclasses.
