Net_LDAP2 is the successor of Net_LDAP which is a clone of Perl's
Net::LDAP object interface to directory servers. It contains most of
Net::LDAP's features but has some of its own too.

With Net_LDAP2 you have:

* A simple object-oriented interface to connections, searches entries
  and filters.
* Support for TLS and LDAP v3.
* Simple modification, deletion and creation of LDAP entries.
* Support for schema handling.

Net_LDAP2 layers itself on top of PHP's existing LDAP extensions.
