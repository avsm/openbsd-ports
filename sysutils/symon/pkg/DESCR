symon is a lightweight system monitor that measures cpu, memory,
interface and disk statistics every 5 seconds. This information is
then spooled over "the network" to symux for further processing.

The port will yield 4 packages: 
symon-mon-${V}.tgz : symon daemon and manual
symon-mux-${V}.tgz : symux daemon, manual and auxilliary scripts
symon-web-${V}.tgz : web frontend
symon-${V}.tgz     : all of the above rolled into a single package
