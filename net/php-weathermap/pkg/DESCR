Weathermap is a network visualisation tool, to take data you already
have and show you an overview of your network in map form.  Extensive
customisation features and an optional map editor are provided.

Support is built in for RRD, MRTG (RRD and old log-format), and
tab-delimited text files. Other sources are via plugins or external
scripts. Weathermap can also be integrated with Cacti.
