+---------------
| The RADIUS configuration files belong in /etc/raddb.  Examples
| and extra documentation can be found in the following locations:
| 
|     ${PREFIX}/share/examples/radiusd-cistron
|     ${PREFIX}/share/doc/radiusd-cistron
| 
| You will need to edit /etc/rc.local as appropriate and add a
| section similiar to the following:
| 
|     if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/radiusd ]; then
|             ${PREFIX}/sbin/radiusd -y && echo -n ' radiusd'
|     fi
| 
| RADIUS accounting information is created by default in /var/log/radacct. 
| This directory must be created before it can be used.
| 
|     install -d -m 700 -o root -g wheel /var/log/radacct
| 
| (see radiusd(8) for available options)
