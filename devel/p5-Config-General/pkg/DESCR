This module opens a config file and parses its contents
for you. After parsing the module returns a hash structure
which contains the representation of the config file.

The format of config files supported by Config::General is
inspired by the well known apache config format, in fact,
this module is 100% read-compatible to apache configs, but
you can also just use simple name/value pairs in your config
files.

In addition to the capabilities of a apache config file
the module supports some enhancements such as here-documents, 
C-style comments or multiline options. It is also possible to
save the config back to disk, which makes the module a
perfect backend for configuration interfaces.

It is possible to use variables in config files and there
also exists support for object oriented access to the
configuration.
