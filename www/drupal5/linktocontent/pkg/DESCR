This allows the `easy' insertion of link to nodes and menus
in tinyMCE.

The activation is a bit complicated:
- activate the module
- activate the plugins in the tinyMCE profiles that need it
- set up administer link-to-content in appropriate roles
- go to the link-to-content administration pages, and select
the type of content you want to see in the menus
