Now that PostgreSQL is installed, you should read the documentation and
implementation guides. These can be found at:

		http://www.PostgreSQL.org/docs

You may wish to subscribe to the PostgreSQL user-support mailing list.
Send an e-mail to pgsql-questions-request@postgresql.org with the
text "subscribe" in the message body.

The user pgsql has been created with a home directory of
!!PREFIX!!/pgsql.  A sample startup script, rc.pgsql, can be
found in that directory.  Other directories used by PostgreSQL are:

executables		!!PREFIX!!/bin
libraries		!!PREFIX!!/lib
pgsql lib directory	!!PREFIX!!/lib/pgsql
include files		!!PREFIX!!/include/pgsql
man pages		!!PREFIX!!/man
doc files		!!PREFIX!!/share/doc/pgsql
database files		!!PREFIX!!/pgsql

PostgreSQL has a section for SQL man pages.  These pages have
been installed in !!PREFIX!!/pgsql/man/manl.  To access these
pages use the command:

	man -C !!PREFIX!!/pgsql/man.conf man-page

If this does not work you must also add !!PREFIX!!/pgsql/man
to your MANPATH.

If you build PostgreSQL with TCL support you can use the TCL/TK based
database frontend "pgaccess" for database operations.  See:

	!!PREFIX!!/pgsql/pgaccess/README.pga

for more information on pgaccess.
