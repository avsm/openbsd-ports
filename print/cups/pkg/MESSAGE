To enable CUPS, execute '${PREFIX}/sbin/cups-enable' as root.
To disable CUPS, execute '${PREFIX}/sbin/cups-disable' as root.

To start cups at boot time, add the following to
/etc/rc.local:

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/cupsd ]; then
	#chgrp _cups /dev/ulpt[0-1] # uncomment if using USB printer
	echo y | ${PREFIX}/sbin/cups-enable > /dev/null
	echo -n ' cupsd'; ${PREFIX}/sbin/cupsd
fi

Starting cupsd will overwrite /etc/printcap. A backup copy of this file
is saved as /etc/printcap.pre-cups by '${PREFIX}/sbin/cups-enable'
and will be restored when you run '${PREFIX}/sbin/cups-disable'.

If you want to use CUPS bundled PPD files (i.e. drivers), you'll need to
install ghostscript.  Also if you want to print on non-PostScript
printers, you will most probably want to install the foomatic-filters
package which provides a universal filter script.
