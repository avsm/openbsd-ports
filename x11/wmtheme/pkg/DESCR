wmtheme is a utility which, generally speaking, allows you to perform
certain operations on themes by name. For example, to rename do wmtheme
-r oldname newname; to activate do wmtheme name, to get from themes.org
do wmtheme -g name.

Furthermore, it takes great care to make installation painless, in spite
of evolving formats, packaging carelessness, and incompatibility between
old themes and current window managers. wmtheme -i theme-package.tar.gz
will almost always result in a correct installation. It will also take
steps to clean up settings that don't belong in themes, and disable
suspicious-looking shell commands (these sorts of things might occur in
Window Maker or Blackbox themes). This behavior can be turned off,
however.

Supports themes for the following:
   - AfterStep (astheme)
   - Blackbox (bbtheme)
   - Enlightenment (etheme)
   - Golem (gotheme)
   - gtk+ (gtktheme)
   - IceWM (itheme)
   - Oroborus (ortheme)
   - Sawfish (sftheme)
   - Window Maker (wmtheme)
   - xmms (xmtheme)
