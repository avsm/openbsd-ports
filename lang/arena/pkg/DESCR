The Arena language was designed with the following main features in
mind, most of which were added on top of a very C-like core to support
better ad-hoc scripting:
* syntax similar to ANSI C
* standard library similar to ANSI C
* automatic memory management
* runtime polymorphism
* support for exceptions
* support for anonymous functions
