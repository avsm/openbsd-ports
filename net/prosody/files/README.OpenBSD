Using Prosody in an OpenBSD environment

1) Prosody documentation is available online at:

   http://prosody.im/doc/configure

   Use this information to edit:

   _SYSCONFDIR_/prosody/prosody.cfg.lua

   to your liking.

2) Prosody has been modified to use privilege dropping.  As such, you
   will need to initially start prosody as root:

   # /usr/local/sbin/prosody

   And likewise for using the prosodyctl command:

   # /usr/local/sbin/prosodyctl adduser me@my.domain
