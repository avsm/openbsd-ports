Status.net has been installed into ${PREFIX}/statusnet .

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
    # ln -s ../statusnet /var/www/htdocs/statusnet
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)


See ${PREFIX}/README.OpenBSD for information about configuring and running
Status.net on OpenBSD.
