libpcapnav is a libpcap wrapper library that allows navigation to
arbitrary locations in a tcpdump trace file between reads. The API is
intentionally much like that of the pcap library. You can navigate in
trace files both in time and space: you can jump to a packet which is at
appr. 2/3 of the trace, or you can jump as closely as possible to a
packet with a given timestamp, and then read packets from there. In
addition, the API provides convenience functions for manipulating
timeval structures.
