Notes on Preparing X-CD-Roast for Operation
-------------------------------------------
Due to cdrecord's -scanbus option being wholly unusable under
OpenBSD, you will need to manually specify the device by using the
-f option of xcdroast.

Find your CD device(s), e.g.:
	dmesg |egrep "cd0|cd1"
	cd0 at scsibus0 targ 0 lun 0: <HITACHI, DVD-ROM GD-5000, 0213>
	cd1 at scsibus1 targ 0 lun 0: <PLEXTOR, CD-R PX-W8432T, 1.09>

Specify your devices (:bus,targ,lun is optional):
	# xcdroast -f /dev/rcd0c,/dev/rcd1c

To begin generating a configuration file, simply run xcdroast as root
with the correct options.  If you wish to enable CD burning for
non-root users, click the "Activate Non-Root-Mode" button.  You will be
presented with the list of commands that are to be executed and
have the opportunity to cancel.
