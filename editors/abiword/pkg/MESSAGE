Abiword needs to have XFree86 type1 module loaded to run correctly, you just
have to add the following line in the module section :
Load "type1"

You must also add the ${PREFIX}/share/AbiSuite/fonts directory to your
X server's font path.  For XFree86, add the line:

FontPath "${PREFIX}/share/AbiSuite/fonts"

in the "Files" section of your /etc/X11/XF86Config file.
If you use a different X server, please see its documentation on how to do
this.

Then re-start your X server.
