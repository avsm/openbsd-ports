This class is a Ebay specialization of WWW::Search. It handles making
and interpreting Ebay searches.

This class exports no public interface; all interaction should be done
through WWW::Search objects.

The search is done against CURRENT running AUCTIONS only. (NOT completed
auctions, NOT eBay Stores items, NOT Buy-It-Now only items.) (If you
want to search completed auctions, use the WWW::Search::Ebay::Completed
module.) (If you want to search eBay Stores, use the
WWW::Search::Ebay::Stores module.)
