		Welcome to the OpenBSD ports collection.

The OpenBSD ports tree is always growing. Therefor it is essential
that you continue to update your ports dir thru cvs or ftp.

No matter how fast we update the tree it seems that we are always
behind.  For this reason you will sometimes find a port that is
marked as BROKEN.  If you try to build the port you will see a
message something like:

   ===> xxx-1.0 is marked as broken: newer version available.

This means we know there is a newer version of the application but
have not yet had time to update the port.  If you get this message
all may not be lost.  If the old sources are still available (and
this is often the case) you can force a build using the old sources
using the command:

	make NO_IGNORE=yes
	sudo make NO_IGNORE=yes install

If youre feeling generous a better solution is to update the port
to use the new sources and feed the changes back to the project.
If you are interested in contributing (or creating a new port)
please visit

If you would like to search for a given port, you can do so easily
by saying:

	make search key="<keyword>"

Which will generate a list of all ports matching <keyword>.

NOTE:  This tree can GROW significantly in size during normal usage!
The distribution tar files can and do accumulate in /usr/ports/distfiles,
and the individual ports will also use up lots of space in their work
subdirectories unless you remember to "make clean" after you're done
building a given port.  /usr/ports/distfiles can also be periodically
cleaned without ill-effect, though if you don't have the original
distribution tarball(s) for something on CDROM then you will need to pull
it all over your network connection again if you ever try to build the
associated port.
