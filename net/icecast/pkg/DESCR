Icecast is a streaming media server which currently supports Ogg
Vorbis and MP3 audio streams. It can be used to create an Internet
radio station or a privately running jukebox and many things in
between. It is very versatile in that new formats can be added
relatively easily and supports open standards for communication and
interaction.

Icecast v2 is a complete rewrite of the old Icecast streaming server.
It was designed to be highly efficient and have low memory requirements.

Additional features are, among others:

   * a web-based administration interface including simple file serving
     (disabled by default on OpenBSD) - seeking in such served files is
     possible
   * supports listing in stream directories
   * new relay system
   * listener authentication
   * multi-level fallbacks
   * "burst-on-connect" to significantly reduce buffering latency on the
     client side
   * Shoutcast-style client support (allows use of Shoutcast DSP and
     NSV support using their native tools)

Security features include chroot()ing and dropping privileges, if
configured to do so.
