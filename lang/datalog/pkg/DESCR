The Datalog package contains a lightweight deductive database system.
Queries and database updates are expressed using Datalog -- a
declarative logic language in which each formula is a function-free
Horn clause, and every variable in the head of a clause must appear
in the body of the clause. The use of Datalog syntax and an
implementation based on tabling intermediate results, ensures that
all queries terminate.
