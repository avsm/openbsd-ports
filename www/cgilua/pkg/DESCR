GILua is a tool for creating dynamic web pages and manipulating input
data from forms. It is simple but powerful, allowing complex tasks to be
carried out with minimum effort. Typical applications that can be
developed with CGILua include, for instance, web based information
systems accessing external data (databases) and gateways to existing
systems.

CGILua uses the interpreted language Lua as a server-side scripting
language for creating dynamic Web pages. Both pure Lua Scripts and Lua
Pages are supported by CGILua. A Lua script is essentially a Lua program
that creates the whole contents of a web page and returns it to the web
server. A Lua page is a conventional markup text (HTML, XML etc) file
that embeds Lua code using some special tags.
