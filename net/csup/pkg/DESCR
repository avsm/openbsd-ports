csup is a software package for updating collections of files across
a network.  It is a rewrite of the CVSup client program in C.

Unlike more traditional network distribution packages, such as rdist and
sup, csup has specific optimizations for distributing CVS repositories.
csup takes advantage of the properties of CVS repositories and the files
they contain (in particular, RCS files), enabling it to perform updates
much faster than traditional systems.
