Goal: an easy to use cross-platform panoramic imaging toolchain
based on the Panorama Tools library.

With hugin you can assemble a mosaic of photographs into a
complete immersive panorama, stitch any series of overlapping
pictures and much more.

This package contains the following programs:

 - hugin, The main program, a GUI for the panorama tools suite
   and some programs included here.

 - nona, a simple replacement for PTStitcher (doesn't support most
   features of PTStitcher, but is faster, opensource and
   will be extended in the future).
 
 - nona_gui, nona with a graphical progress bar.

 - autooptimiser, optimise a panorama pairwise, starting from an
   anchor image. cmd line version of the pairwise mode in hugin
