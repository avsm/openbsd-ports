ikeman is a tool designed to simplify management of X.509 public key
infrastructure used to create IPsec flows by isakmpd(8) or iked(8).
It displays all PKI data in a hierarchical view and can also create
new certificate authorities, sign new certificate requests and revoke
or un-revoke currently loaded certificates.

All this in a user-friendly ncurses GUI, which also warns user about
errors like already expired, revoked or not yet valid certificates.
