HTML::CGIChecker is a module for web developers to parse HTML and
to detect HTML code that could break a page in some way.

This module is not a HTML validator, but it allows one to check the
HTML code that users post to a web application, for example to a
discussion board, to prevent them to post a piece of code that would
render the rest of a page it is displayed on unusable.

Using it one also can deny javascripts, images, tables or any other
tags on an individual basis. It also can check for correct quoting
and correct URLs.

The module can autocorrect some common bad users' behaviour, for
example the use of unescaped HTML brackets in a chat room, etc.

It is easy to use and very useful in any CGI application in which
you want its users to be able to use HTML in their posts to some
customizable extent. It is object oriented and designed to be easily
extensible.
