The BBC launched an iPhone-specific version of the streaming iPlayer
service in March 2008. As the iPhone does not support Flash video,
this variant of the service uses browser sniffing to serve h.264
(`MP4') video to clients.

By pretending to be an iPhone, it's possible to download the MP4
files for offline viewing. You can find out more about the history
of this, and of the BBC's repeated attempts to prevent this, on the
Beebhack Wiki, http://beebhack.wikia.com/wiki/IPhone_H.264_version.
