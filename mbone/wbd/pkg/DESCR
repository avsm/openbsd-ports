	 	 WBD is a shared whiteboard
                 compatible with the LBL
                 whiteboard, WB. Binaries are
                 available for MS Windows
                 95/98/NT4, as well as Solaris2.5
                 and Irix6.2. It was originally
                 written by Julian Highfield at
                 Loughborough University and has
                 since been modified by Kristian
                 Hasler at UCL. This version has
                 also been designed to work with
                 the ReLaTe integrated interface.
