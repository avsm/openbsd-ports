libcdaudio is a multi-platform CD player development library which
works with NetBSD, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and Irix. It
includes a basic command set for controlling the operation of the
CD-ROM drive as well as functions for accessing both the CDDB, CD
Index, and Cover Art Index.

The entire libcdaudio API may be found in the libcdaudio
programmer's manual at "http://cdcd.undergrid.net/libcdaudio/manual/".
The interface to the given functions will remain as they are
specified, although new functions may continue to be added.
