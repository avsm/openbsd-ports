Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) is a messaging
architecture and a Component Object Model based API for Microsoft
Windows. MAPI allows client programs to become (e-mail)
messaging-enabled, -aware, or -based by calling MAPI subsystem routines
that interface with certain messaging servers. While MAPI is designed to
be independent of the protocol, it is usually used with MAPI/RPC, the
proprietary protocol that Microsoft Outlook uses to communicate with
Microsoft Exchange.

These functions allow you to access a MAPI compliant email server.
