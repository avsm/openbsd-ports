Vim is an almost compatible version of the UNIX text editor vi.  Only the 'Q'
command is missing (you don't need it).

Many new features have been added:
    multiple windows and buffers, multi level undo, command line history,
    filename completion, selection highlighting, block operations (including
    column/rectangular blocks), etc.

	an X-windows aware or a full X-windows GUI version can also be built
	that allows full use of the mouse and pull-down menus

Portability to all UNIX platforms, Amiga DOS, MS-DOS, MS-Windows NT, and
    Archimedes.
