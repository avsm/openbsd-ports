w3m is a lightweight text-mode pager that doubles as a WWW browser.

It's main features (over lynx) are:

	* HTML tables
	* HTML frames
	* HTML from stdin
	* horizontal scrolling

While it may not be as strictly accurate as lynx, w3m seems to render
HTML pages more intelligently and more compactly. 

The following notes come from the README:
------------------------------------------------------------

     w3m is a pager with WWW capability. It IS a pager, but it can be
used as a text-mode WWW browser.

     The features of w3m are as follows:

* When reading HTML document, you can follow links and view images
  (using external image viewer).
* It has 'internet message mode', which determines the type of document
  from header. If the Content-Type: field of the document is text/html,
  that document is displayed as HTML document.
* You can change URL description like 'http://hogege.net' in plain text
  into link to that URL.

Current problems are: 

* Resize behaviour is imcomplete.
* It can't show images inline. (It seems to be impossible as far as using
  xterm)
* It doesn't decode MIME-body of the document.
* Online manuals are poor.
