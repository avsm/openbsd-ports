xmlwf  uses the Expat library to determine if an XML document is well-formed.  
It is non-validating.

xmlwf is normally distributed with the expat library.
OpenBSD includes expat in base, because it's needed by ports and Xwindows.

xmlwf is not needed for anything in base nor in X.
Hence the separate package.
