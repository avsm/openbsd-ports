C->Haskell is an interface generator that simplifies the development
of Haskell bindings to C libraries.  The tool processes existing C
header files that determine data layout and function signatures on the
C side, in conjunction with Haskell modules that specify Haskell-side
type signatures and marshaling details. Hooks embedded in the Haskell
code signal access to C structures and functions; they are expanded by
the interfacing tool in conjunction with information in the
corresponding C header file.  A noteworthy property is the lightweight
nature of the approach.
