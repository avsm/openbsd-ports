The BWidget toolkit is a high-level widget set for Tcl/Tk built using 
native Tcl/Tk 8.x namespaces.

The BWidgets have a professional look and feel as in other well known 
Toolkits (Tix or Incr Widgets), but the concept is radically different 
because everything is pure Tcl/Tk. No platform dependencies, and no 
compiling required. The code is 100% Pure Tcl/Tk.
