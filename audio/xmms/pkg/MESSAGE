To use native audio, pick the Sun output plugin in the XMMS
preferences window (ctrl-p).

Depending on your audio hardware and driver, you may want to
fine-tune the buffer size in audio preferences. Usually you
should decrease the buffer size if your hardware can handle it.

Please direct issues regarding the Sun output driver to the
author, ${MAINTAINER}.

If you need vorbis input or esd output, please look at 
${PKGNAME-vorbis} and ${PKGNAME-esd}.
