                                XKeyCaps

                 a keymap editor for the X window system
           ``A program so good that you only have to use it once.''

                            by Jamie Zawinski

xkeycaps is a graphical front-end to xmodmap.  It opens a window that looks
like a keyboard; moving the mouse over a key shows what KeySyms and Modifier
bits that key generates.  Clicking on a key simulates KeyPress/KeyRelease
events on the window of your choice.  It is possible to change the KeySyms
and Modifiers generated by a key through a mouse-based interface.  This
program can also write an input file for xmodmap to recreate your changes 
in future sessions.  See the man page for more details.

        The latest version of xkeycaps is always available at
