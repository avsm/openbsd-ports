Slim can be started at boot time by adding the following to
!!SYSCONFDIR!!/rc.local:

if [ -x !!PREFIX!!/bin/slim ]; then
        echo -n ' slim'; ( sleep 5; !!PREFIX!!/bin/slim -d ) &
fi

The sleep 5 is here to be sure tty flags are correctly set, you can try
to directly run !!PREFIX!!/bin/slim -d instead.

On i386, amd64 and VGA-based alpha, slim is launched on vt05 like xdm.

If you're on a zaurus you'll have to change this setting to vt01 in
!!SYSCONFDIR!!/slim.conf.

If you're on an arch which doesn't handle virtual terminals (like
macppc, sparc, sparc64, TGA-based alpha, hp300 or vax), you will have to
explicitely set getty off on ttyC0 in /etc/ttys to avoid input
conflicts:

ttyC0 "/usr/libexec/getty Pc" vt220 off secure
