Eagle (Extensible Adaptable Generalized Logic Engine) is an
implementation of the Tcl language for the Common Language Runtime
(CLR). Eagle was written from scratch based on the design and
implementation of Tcl 8.4 and provides most of the functionality of the
Tcl 8.4 interpreter while borrowing selected features from Tcl 8.5 and
the upcoming Tcl 8.6, in addition to adding entirely new features.
