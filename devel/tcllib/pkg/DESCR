A collection of pure-Tcl utility modules for Tcl that provide a wide
variety of functionality, from implementations of standard data
structures to implementations of common networking protocols.  The
intent is to collect commonly used functions into a single library,
which users can rely on to be available and stable.

Included are the following modules, and much more:

base64		base64, uuencode, yencode encoder and decoder
calendar	date & time operations. In development.
cmdline		command line argument processor similar to opt
