This module exports one function, "declare", for building named objects
with a declarative syntax, similar to how Jifty::DBI::Schema defines its
columns.

In list context, "declare" returns a list of name/object pairs in the
order of declaration (allowing duplicates), suitable for putting into a
hash. In scalar context, "declare" returns a hash reference.
