This port contains the libraries/headers as well as examples and documentation
needed to start developing with Arduino.

For now it doesn't contain the frontend application yet, instead a Makefile
and various helper scripts are provided. Please use
${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/arduinoproject to create a new project directory.
