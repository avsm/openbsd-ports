GTK ChTheme is a small and fast command line utility to switch GTK
themes on the fly. It also has an optional GUI to preview the requested
theme and change the font used with it, an optional GUI dock, and it can
install themes downloaded from http://gtk.themes.org, preview them, or
switch to them immediately.
