The intltool package is a set of tools for translating the contents of
data files using the gettext translation framework.

The intltool collection can be used to do these things:
 * Extract translatable strings from various source files (.xml.in,
   .glade, .desktop.in, .server.in, .oaf.in).
 * Collect the extracted strings together with messages from traditional
   source files (.c, .h) in po/$(PACKAGE).pot.
 * Merge back the translations from .po files into .xml, .desktop and
   .oaf files.  This merge step will happen at build resp. installation
   time.
