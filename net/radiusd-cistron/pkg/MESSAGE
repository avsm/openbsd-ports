The RADIUS configuration files belong in ${SYSCONFDIR}/raddb.  Examples
and extra documentation can be found in the following locations:

    ${PREFIX}/share/examples/radiusd-cistron
    ${PREFIX}/share/doc/radiusd-cistron

To have the daemon start at boot time, you will need to edit
/etc/rc.local as appropriate and add a section similar to the following:

    if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/radiusd ]; then
	    ${PREFIX}/sbin/radiusd -y && echo -n ' radiusd'
    fi

See radiusd(8) for more available options.  RADIUS accounting
information is created in /var/log/radacct.
