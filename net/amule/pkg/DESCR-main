aMule is a peer to peer file sharing client, based on the well known
eMule.

If you get `Bad file descriptor' errors, be sure to raise the file
descriptor limits.

This package includes amulegui, an experimental front-end which can connect
to a distant amuled, and mldonkey_importer, to import your old mldonkey
temporary files.

Subpackages:
* amuled: daemon version without graphical interface and command-line client.
* amuleweb: web server control interface.
