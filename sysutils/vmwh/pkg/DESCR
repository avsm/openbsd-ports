vmwh is a vmware helper for X11, developed on OpenBSD to run in userland
alongside the vmt(4) vmware kernel driver and the vmmouse Xorg driver.
It detects when the mouse cursor switches back to the host ("ungrabs")
and sends the guest's X11 clipboard data (read from xclip) to the host
through the vmware backdoor, which gets put onto the host's clipboard.
It then detects when the mouse cursor switches back to the guest
("grabs") and replaces the X11 clipboard contents (via xclip) with the
host's, which is read through the vmware backdoor.
