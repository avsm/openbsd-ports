This is completely experimental ! This is there so that people can
play with it.

Things will break !  This is totally expected. Dependencies are very much
incomplete,

There are issues in kde proper (like duh, what do you expect, this is a 
beta), and some issues related to OpenBSD.

For now, the most annoying issue is that cmake does not handle our shared
libraries correctly *at all*.

So, the library dependencies between stuff within kde are broken so far.

Also, this kde4 will leave you with quite a few processes lying around
when you've played with it.
