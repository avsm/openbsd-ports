The Evolution Data Server package provides a unified backend for
programs that work with contacts, tasks, and calendar information. It
was originally developed for Evolution (hence the name), but is now used
by other packages as well. 

The Evolution Data Server provides a single database for common,
desktop-wide information, such as a user's address book or calendar
events.
