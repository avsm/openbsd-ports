Shisen-Sho is similiar to Mahjongg and uses the same set of tiles as Mahjongg. 
The object of the game is to remove all tiles from the field. Only two matching
tiles can be removed at a time. Two tiles can only be removed if they can be 
connected with at most three connected lines. Lines can be horizontal or 
vertical but not diagonal.
