-htpasswd is used to create and update the flat-files used to store usernames and password for basic authentication of HTTP users\&. If htpasswd cannot access a file, such as not being able to write to the output file or not being able to read the file in order to update it, it returns an error status and makes no changes\&.

-Resources available from the Apache HTTP server can be restricted to just the users listed in the files created by htpasswd\&. This program can only manage usernames and passwords stored in a flat-file\&. It can encrypt and display password information for use in other types of data stores, though\&. To use a DBM database see dbmmanage\&.
