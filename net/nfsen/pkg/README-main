Running NfSen on OpenBSD
========================

Basic installation
------------------
To proceed with an installation or upgrade, adjust ${SYSCONFDIR}/nfsen.conf
as required and run the configuration tool:

# install-nfsen.pl ${SYSCONFDIR}/nfsen.conf

This will read the configuration file, create directories and files
as needed, and handle upgrades from previous versions.

It is highly advisable to read the documentation available at
http://nfsen.sourceforge.net/

Note, you may export netflow-compatible data from PF via pflow(4).

Chroot considerations
---------------------
NfSen is written with chroot in mind and is capable of communicating
with the main nfcap daemon running outside the jail.  Adapting to this
configuration is a simple matter of moving a few files around (while
the daemon is stopped).

# mkdir -p /var/www/var/db
# mv /var/db/nfsen /var/www/var/db/nfsen
# ln -s /var/www/var/db/nfsen /var/db/nfsen

PortTracker
-----------
This optional module splits up traffic by port number.  It can be useful
but is somewhat experimental.  You can attempt to use it like this:

- uncomment the sample PortTracker entry from the plugin
section in the sample ${SYSCONFDIR}/nfsen.conf

- start nftrack:
# sudo -u _nfcapd nftrack -I -d /var/db/nfsen/ports-db/

- restart nfsen
# /etc/rc.d/nfsen reload

After the next processing interval, PortTracker should generate
data and graphs.  If you have problems then examine system logs (you
may need to increase logging levels).
