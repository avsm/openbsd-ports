The Notification plugin provides various ways to notify the user of new
and possibly unread mail.
Currently, the following modules are implemented:
* A system tray icon, optionally with popup on new mail arrival
* A popup window using devel/libnotify
* A mail banner (stocks ticker-like widget)
* Support for a command to be issued on new mail arrival
* Support for displaying mail status on a LCD
