To finish the install of ${PKGNAME}, you need
to enable the module using the following command

	${PREFIX}/sbin/${MODAPACHE_ENABLE}

Also, see the example configuration file:
${PREFIX}/share/examples/mod_ruby/httpd.conf

If you already have Apache running on your machine,
you should not use "apachectl restart" - instead,
you should fully stop and then start the server.
