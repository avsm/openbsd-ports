"Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::FastMmap" is a fast session storage
plugin for Catalyst that uses an mmap'ed file to act as a shared memory
interprocess cache. It is based on Cache::FastMmap.
    
This module is derived from Catalyst::Plugin::Session::FastMmap code,
and has been heavily modified since.
