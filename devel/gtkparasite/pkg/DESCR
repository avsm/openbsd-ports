Parasite is a debugging and development tool that runs inside your GTK+
application's process. It can inspect your application, giving you
detailed information on your UI, such as the hierarchy, X window IDs,
widget properties, and more. You can modify properties on the fly in
order to experiment with the look of your UI.  To use it, run
GTK_MODULES=gtkparasite gtk_app.
