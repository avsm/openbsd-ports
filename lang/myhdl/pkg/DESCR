MyHDL is an open source Python package that lets you go from Python to
silicon. With MyHDL, you can use Python as a hardware description and
verification language. Furthermore, you can convert MyHDL code, that was
developed towards implementation, to Verilog and VHDL automatically, and
take it to a silicon implementation from there.
