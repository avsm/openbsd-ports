ColdSync is a robust, extensible, portable tool for synchronizing
PalmOS devices (PalmPilot et al.) with a Unix workstation.

It runs without a GUI, and therefore allows you to sync without
running X.  ColdSync is extensible through the use of conduits,
which allow it to share information with other applications.
