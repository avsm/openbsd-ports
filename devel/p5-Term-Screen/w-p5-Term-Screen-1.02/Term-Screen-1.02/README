Term::Screen version 1.01
=========================

This module provides a simple interface to the terminal control features
for character mode terminals.

INSTALLATION

This module will build in the usual way :

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

This last step may need to be done as a user with permission to write into
the Perl library directories - if you are not able to do this you may run
the first step with:

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/some/directory/you/can/write/to

And then run the rest of the procedure as usual - you will need to add
that path to @INC as described in the FAQ or in the manpage for the 'lib'
pragma.

DEPENDENCIES

This module depends on version 1.01 or greater of Term::Cap - whilst this
module has been in the core Perl distribution for some years it had 
previously required a patch - 1.01 is available as part of the 5.7.2
development release (not intended for general release) and will be in
5.8.0 - it is hoped that 1.02 will be released to CPAN for those who
dont want to upgrade their version of Perl just now.

TO DO

Make a terminfo version of this so better function key support would be
built in.

Make an MS-DOS version and a MAC version and an OS/2 version and a VMS 
version, and ... so we can stop seeing "how can I read one char questions"

SUPPORT

Please contact the current maintainer of this module to report any bugs
or suggest changes to this module.
