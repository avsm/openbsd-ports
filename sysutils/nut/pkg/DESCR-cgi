These CGI scripts can connect to NUT to query UPS information and
statistics and display them on a web page.

By default these scripts are designed to work within OpenBSD's chrooted
Apache webserver.  If you disable the chroot feature you can use Apache's
SetEnv directive to override the configuration file location by setting
the NUT_CGICONFPATH environment variable.
