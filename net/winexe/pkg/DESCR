winexe connects to the IPC$ share on a Windows host, copies an executable
file if it's not already available, and starts it as a service to create a
pipe over which programs can be run remotely.

No special configuration is required on the Windows host. Providing you
have credentials giving a suitable level of access to the relevant system,
you can use this to provide an interactive command shell, or otherwise
execute programs remotely (also suitable for script-based use).
