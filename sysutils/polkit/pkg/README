| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In most situations, PolicyKit will require a session to be marked as
"active" before granting privileges. This is done using ConsoleKit, so
you will most likely want to install the consolekit package along with
polkit.

On OpenBSD, the following identities are setup by default:
Administrative users	-> "wheel" group
Standard users 		-> "users" group

Disabling polkit
================
If you'd like to completely disable privilege granting through the
PolicyKit framework, create the file:
    ${SYSCONFDIR}/polkit-1/nullbackend.conf.d/99-nullbackend.conf
containing the following lines:
[Configuration]
Priority=99

Security considerations
=======================
polkitd(8) runs setuid(2) root in order to allow applications
to request additional fine-grained privileges (e.g. adjust the clock,
change the timezone...). Access to these privileges is controlled by
policy files and user passwords.
