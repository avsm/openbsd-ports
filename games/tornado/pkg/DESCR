Tornado is a clone of Ouranos (Weather War).  The goal of the game is to
destroy the opponent's house with certain weather phenomena: rain,
snow, hail, lightning, and tornadoes.  The game can be played together
(two players), against the computer (or two computer players against
each other) or over a TCP connection.
