Dynagen is a text-based front-end, using an INI-like configuration
file to provision Dynamips emulator networks.

It takes care of specifying the right port adapters, generating
and matching up NIO descriptors, specifying bridges, frame-relay,
ATM switches, etc.

It also provides a management CLI for listing devices, suspending
and reloading instances, determining and managing idle-pc values, etc.
