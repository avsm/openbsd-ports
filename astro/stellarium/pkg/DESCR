Stellarium is a free open source planetarium for your computer.
Stellarium renders 3D photo-realistic skies in real time with OpenGL.
It displays stars, constellations, planets, nebulas and others things
like ground, landscape, atmosphere, etc. It shows a realistic sky in 3D,
just like what you see with the naked eye, binoculars or a telescope.
It is being used in planetarium projectors. Just set your coordinates
and go.
