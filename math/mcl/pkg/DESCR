The Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL) is a fast and scalable
algorithm for clustering graphs based on simulation of
stochastic flow.  The algorithm was developed by Stijn van
Dongen at the Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science in the
Netherlands.

The MCL algorithm is very fast, very scalable, and has a number
of attractive properties causing it to deliver high-quality
clusterings.
