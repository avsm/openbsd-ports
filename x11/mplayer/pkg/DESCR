MPlayer is a movie player for LINUX (runs on many other Unices, and
non-x86 CPUs, see the documentation). It plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI,
VIVO, ASF/WMV, QT/MOV, FLI, NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM, RoQ, and some
RealMedia files, supported by many native, XAnim, and Win32 DLL codecs.
You can watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, FLI, and even DivX movies too
(and you don't need the avifile library at all!).

Another big feature of mplayer is the wide range of supported output
drivers.  It works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev, AAlib, but
you can use SDL (and this way all drivers of SDL), VESA (on every VESA
compatible card, even without X!), and some lowlevel card-specific
drivers (for Matrox, 3Dfx and Radeon) too! Most of them supports
software or hardware scaling, so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen.
MPlayer supports displaying through some hardware MPEG decoder boards,
such as the DVB and DXR3/Hollywood+ !  And what about the nice big
antialiased shaded subtitles (9 supported types!!!) with european/ISO
8859-1,2 (hungarian, english, czech, etc), cyrillic, korean fonts, and
OSD?

MPlayer might fail due to lack of shared memory, eg when using gui mode under
KDE.  You can use config to change the shared memory limits without needing to
recompile the kernel, e.g., "config -e -o bsd2 bsd".  On i386 it should be
sufficient to add 8 to shmseg and 2048 to shmmaxpgs. 

Flavors:

  sdl: enables sdl, requires devel/sdl

  ggi: enables ggi, requires graphics/ggi

  debug: enables debugging information

  mad: enables mad, requires audio/mad

  no_x11: disable audio/video output.

  win32: enables win32 codecs (i386-only)  To use this flavor, your
         kernel must be rebuilt with option USER_LDT

  vorbis: enables vorbis, requires audio/libvorbis. There is a hack
          that allows AVI files to contain an Ogg Vorbis audio stream,
          but makes them incompatible with standard AVI. You need this
          to play those AVIs
