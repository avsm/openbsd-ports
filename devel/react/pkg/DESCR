React is an OCaml module for functional reactive programming (FRP).
It provides support to program with time varying values: declarative
events and signals.

React is made of a single, independent, module and distributed under
the BSD3 license.

Given an absolute notion of time the Rtime module helps you to
manage a timeline and provides time stamp events, delayed events
and delayed signals.
