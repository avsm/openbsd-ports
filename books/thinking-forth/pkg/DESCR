Thinking Forth is a book about the philosophy of problem solving and
programming style, applied to the unique programming language Forth.
Published first in 1984, it could be among the timeless classics of
computer books, such as Fred Brooks' The Mythical Man-Month and Donald
Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming.

Many software engineering principles discussed here have been
rediscovered in eXtreme Programming, including (re)factoring,
modularity, bottom-up and incremental design. Here you'll find all of
those and more - such as the value of analysis and design - described in
Leo Brodie's down-to-earth, humorous style, with illustrations, code
examples, practical real life applications, illustrative cartoons, and
interviews with Forth's inventor, Charles H. Moore as well as other
Forth thinkers.
