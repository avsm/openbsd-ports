The Journal module adds additional fields to all forms in a Drupal site
to allow developers and site administrators to record and track all
actions that have been performed to setup a site or change its
configuration.

Journal is primarily useful for developers and site administrators
working in a team environment. Since Drupal is a full-fledged content
management framework, it is often not easy to communicate, track
and audit all changes that have been applied to a site. Even without
contributed modules one is able to build a totally customized site.

As of now, all journal log entries have to be written manually.
Thus, the significance of journal entries depends on the given
information (by a human). This may change in upcoming versions of
Journal (patches are always welcome).

Journal forces a user to enter a journal entry on system_settings_forms,
because it is obvious that something in the site configuration is
about to be changed.

The journal log is similar to the watchdog log in Drupal core.
However, watchdog logs can be truncated or emptied at any time, so
you would loose all journal entries.

Only users granted the 'access journal' permission are able to add
entries to the journal. Journal form fields may be disabled for
certain forms, for example forms that are displayed in blocks, like
the user login form.
