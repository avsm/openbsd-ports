 UPGRADING
-    If you're upgrading an installation of Bricolage that was previously
-    installed via "make install", then simply upgrade using "make upgrade".
-    If, however, you're upgrading an older installation of Bricolage that
-    didn't have a build system, or it was simply used as-is from Subversion,
-    you'll need to follow the directions below.

-    To upgrade a manual installation of Bricolage, first set the
-    BRICOLAGE_ROOT environment variable to the root of your Bricolage

-    Next, stop the server:

-      $BRICOLAGE_ROOT/bin/bric_apachectl stop

     Save copies of your bricolage.conf and httpd.conf files, so that you
     don't overwrite them:
 
       cp $BRICOLAGE_ROOT/conf/bricolage.conf $BRICOLAGE_ROOT/conf/bricolage.conf.old
       cp $BRICOLAGE_ROOT/conf/httpd.conf $BRICOLAGE_ROOT/conf/httpd.conf.old
 
-    Install the latest Bundle::Bricolage from CPAN to make sure that you
-    have all the needed modules (or read through the list of required
-    modules above and do it yourself).
+    Update the bricolage package.
 
     Delete all existing Mason object files and temporary files:
 
-      rm -rf $BRICOLAGE_ROOT/data/obj/bric_ui/*
-      rm -rf /tmp/bricolage/*
