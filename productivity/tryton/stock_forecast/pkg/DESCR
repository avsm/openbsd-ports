This is the "stock_forecast" module for the Tryton application platform.
It provides the "Forecast" model in Inventory Management.
The Forecast form allow to define the expected stock movement towards
customers in any period of time in the future. A wizard allows to
compute the expected quantities with respect to a period in the past.
Once the form is confirmed, the corresponding moves are created and
spreaded homogeneously across the period. Those moves will allow other
processes to take forecasts into account.
