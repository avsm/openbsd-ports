By using the Test module, you can write test scripts without knowing
the exact output this module expects.

Perl test scripts print to standard output "ok N" for each single
test, where N is an increasing sequence of integers. The first line
output by a standard test script is "1..M" with M being the number
of tests that should be run within the test script.
Test::Harness::runtests(@tests) runs all the testscripts named as
arguments and checks standard output for the expected "ok N" strings.

After all tests have been performed, runtests() prints some performance
statistics that are computed by the Benchmark module.
