The Cyrus SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) Library v2.

SASL is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method for
adding authentication support to connection-based protocols. To use
SASL, a protocol includes a command for identifying and authenticating a
user to a server and for optionally negotiating protection of subsequent
protocol interactions. If its use is negotiated, a security layer is
inserted between the protocol and the connection.

Available flavors:
	db4 - use Berkeley DB v4 for SASLDB (instead of ndbm)
	ldap - enable LDAPDB auxprop plugin and LDAP enabled saslauthd
	mysql pgsql sqlite3 - enable SQL auxprop plugin (choose one)
