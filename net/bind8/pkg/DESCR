This is a replacement for the BIND that is shipped with OpenBSD.

Among other things, BIND 8.x supports notifications, IXFR, dynamic
updates and some support for DNSSEC (for a more complete DNSSEC, use
the BIND 9.x). This port also includes the dnssigner utility from
TISLabs.

More information on BIND is available at http://www.isc.org/.
