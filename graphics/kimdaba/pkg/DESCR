Kphotoalbum is the new name for kimdaba:
a tool to sort your images and recall them easily:

* describe images quickly.  With a few mouse clicks, 
mark all your images from your holiday as being from Italy, 1992. 
kphotoalbum offers two ways of description:
images one at a time, which is useful for writing text about images, 
and All Simultaneously, which is useful for selecting a number of images, 
and setting properties like location, persons on images, and date of image.  

* search for images efficiently. kphotoalbum can describe images with a
number of properties. These includes date, persons on image, location
of image, plus a keyword field the user can use for custom keywords
like Album 7 or Holiday trip to Italy. With KimDaBa you can search
using these categories - for example Find the images with Jesper
on them.  

* browse and View images. When viewing images, your focus often 
changes - one moment you are looking at images from your holiday in 1992, 
and when seeing an image of a friend whom you spent that holiday with, 
your focus suddenly changes, so you want to see all images of that friend.
