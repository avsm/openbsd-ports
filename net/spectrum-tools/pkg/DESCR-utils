Spectrum-Tools is a set of utilities for using the Wi-Spy USB spectrum
analyzer tools from Metageek LLC (http://www.metageek.net). They include
userspace drivers for the hardware (implemented via libusb), a graphing 
UI built on GTK/Cairo, network servers for remote devices, and simple 
utilities for developing additional tools.

This package contains the non-graphical components:

- spectool_raw - a basic dumper from the USB interface to stdout,
without RSSI to dBm conversion. 

- spectool_net - a network server for the cross-platform network
protocol for remote sensors. Supports broadcast announcement, device
locking, remote device configuration, etc
