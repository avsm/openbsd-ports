The kdeadmin package contains packages that usually only a system
administrator might need:

* kcron
    Editor for the cron command scheduler.

* kfile-plugins
    Make Konquerer display additional info on about *.dep and *.rpm files.

* kpackage
    Manager for DEB, RPM and similar software packages.

* kuser
    An user manager.

* secpolicy
    A program to display PAM security policies.

Most of this stuff will be useless/non-working on OpenBSD, actually.
