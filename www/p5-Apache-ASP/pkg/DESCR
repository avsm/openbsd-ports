Apache::ASP provides an Active Server Pages port to the Apache Web
Server with Perl scripting only, and enables developing of dynamic
web applications with session management and embedded perl code.
There are also many powerful extensions, including XML taglibs,
XSLT rendering, and new events not originally part of the ASP API!
