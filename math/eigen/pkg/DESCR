Eigen is a lightweight C++ template library for vector and matrix
math, a.k.a. linear algebra.

Unlike most other linear algebra libraries, Eigen focuses on the
simple mathematical needs of applications: games and other OpenGL
apps, spreadsheets and other office apps, etc. Eigen is dedicated
to providing optimal speed with GCC.
