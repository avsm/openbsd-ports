This package provides a couple of tools to cut and cat MP3 audio files
at the frame level.

 * mp3cut uses a so called 'cue sheet' to cut an MP3 audio file into
   individual pieces (usually tracks)
 * mp3cat concatenates the audio data from one or more MP3 files
 * cddb2cue generates a cue file from a CDDB file
