Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory is a framework which tries to make building complex
GUIs easy, by offering these two main features:

 * Consistent looking GUI without the need to code resp. tune each widget by
   hand. Instead you declare the structure of your GUI, connect it to the
   data of your program (which should be a well defined set of objects) and
   control how this structure is transformed into a specific layout in a
   very generic way.

 * Automatically keep widget and object states in sync (in both directions),
   even with complex data structures with a lot of internal dependencies,
   object nesting etc.
