Postler is a lean mail interface. Messages are read from Maildir folders, HTML
is rendered, composed and spell-checked with WebKitGTK+. The application
consists of independent modules, the reader, viewer and the composer. Each
module runs separately. No network access occurs from within the user interface
by default, offline access is integral. Contact completion and address book
integration are provided by Dexter.
