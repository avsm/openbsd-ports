GNU Source-highlight, given a source file, produces a document with
syntax highlighting. The colors and the styles can be specified (bold,
italics, underline) by means of a configuration file, and some other
options can be specified at the command line.

The program already recognizes many programming languages (e.g., C++,
Java, Perl, etc.) and file formats (e.g., log files, ChangeLog, etc.),
and some output formats (e.g., HTML, ANSI color escape sequences, LaTeX,
etc.). Since version 2.0, it allows you to specify your own input source
language via a simple syntax described later in this manual (Language
Definitions). Since version 2.1, it allows you to specify your own
output format language via a simple syntax described later in this
manual (Output Language Definitions). Since version 2.2, it is able to
generate cross references (e.g., to variable names, field names, etc.)
by relying on the program ctags.
