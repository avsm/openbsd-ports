NAME
    POE::Filter::XML - A POE Filter for parsing XML

SYSNOPSIS
     use POE::Filter::XML;
     my $filter = POE::Filter::XML->new();

     my $wheel = POE::Wheel:ReadWrite->new(
            Filter          => $filter,
            InputEvent      => 'input_event',
     );

DESCRIPTION
    POE::Filter::XML provides POE with a completely encapsulated XML parsing
    strategy for POE::Wheels that will be dealing with XML streams.

    POE::Filter::XML relies upon XML::SAX and XML::SAX::ParserFactory to
    acquire a parser for parsing XML.

    The assumed parser is XML::SAX::Expat::Incremental (Need a real push
    parser)

    Default, the Filter will spit out POE::Filter::XML::Nodes because that
    is what the default XML::SAX compliant Handler produces from the stream
    it is given. You are of course encouraged to override the default
    Handler for your own purposes if you feel POE::Filter::XML::Node to be
    inadequate.

    Also, Filter requires POE::Filter::XML::Nodes for put(). If you are
    wanting to send raw XML, it is recommened that you subclass the Filter
    and override put()

PUBLIC METHODS
    Since POE::Filter::XML follows the POE::Filter API look to POE::Filter
    for documentation. Deviations from Filter API will be covered here.

    new()
        new() accepts a total of three(3) arguments that are all optional:
        (1) a string that is XML waiting to be parsed (i.e. xml received
        from the wheel before the Filter was instantiated), (2) a coderef to
        be executed upon a parsing error, (3) and a XML::SAX compliant
        Handler.

        If no options are specified, then a default coderef containing a
        simple Carp::confess is generated, and a new instance of
        POE::Filter::XML::Handler is used.

    reset()
        reset() is an internal method that gets called when either a
        stream_start(1) POE::Filter::XML::Node gets placed into the filter
        via put(), or when a stream_end(1) POE::Filter::XML::Node is pulled
        out of the queue of finished Nodes via get_one(). This facilitates
        automagical behavior when using the Filter within the XMPP protocol
        that requires a many new stream initiations. This method really
        should never be called outside of the Filter, but it is documented
        here in case the Filter is used outside of the POE context.

        Internally reset() gets another parser, calls reset() on the stored
        handler and then deletes any data in the buffer.

BUGS AND NOTES
    The current XML::SAX::Expat::Incremental version introduces some ugly
    circular references due to the way XML::SAX::Expat constructs itself (it
    stores a references to itself inside the XML::Parser object it
    constructs to get an OO-like interface within the callbacks passed to
    it). Upon destroy, I clean these up with Scalar::Util::weaken and by
    manually calling release() on the ExpatNB object created within
    XML::SAX::Expat::Incremental. This is an ugly hack. If anyone finds some
    subtle behavior I missed, let me know and I will drop XML::SAX support
    all together going back to just plain-old XML::Parser.

    Meta filtering was removed. No one was using it and the increased level
    of indirection was a posible source of performance issues.

    put() now requires POE::Filter::XML::Nodes. Raw XML text can no longer
    be put() into the stream without subclassing the Filter and overriding
    put().

    reset() semantics were properly worked out to now be automagical and
    consistent. Thanks Eric Waters (ewaters@uarc.com).
