If you're installing for the first time or want to change your
configuration, you may want to run the following script as root:
${PREFIX}/lib/mgetty+sendfax/setup

It will help you to create the following configuration files in
${SYSCONFDIR}/mgetty+sendfax:
    faxheader mgetty.config sendfax.config

The faxrm utility and man page have been renamed to avoid conflict with
comms/hylafax:
 faxrm -> mgetty-faxrm
 faxrm(1) -> mgetty-faxrm(1)
