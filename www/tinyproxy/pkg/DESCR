Tinyproxy is a lightweight HTTP/SSL proxy. 
Designed from the from the ground up to be fast and yet small,
it is an ideal solution for sites where a full-featured HTTP

a more demanding HTTP proxy are unavailable.
Tinyproxy is fully compatible with all existing web browsers, 
and has a number of useful features.
