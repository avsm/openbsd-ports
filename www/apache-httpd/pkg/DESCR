The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and
Windows NT. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient
and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the
current HTTP standards.

This package provides an unaudited version of apache.  For security
reasons, users are STRONGLY encouraged to use the system httpd(8)
instead, if at all possible.
