DOSBox is a x86 + DOS-emulator. 

DOSBox emulates CPU:286/386 realmode/protected mode, Directory
FileSystem/XMS/EMS, Tandy/Hercules/CGA/EGA/VGA/VESA graphics
and SoundBlaster/Gravis Ultra Sound cards for excellent sound compatibility
 with older games...

You can "re-live" the good old days with the help of DOSBox, it can run plenty
of the old classics that don't run on your new computer!
