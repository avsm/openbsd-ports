The video(1) utility grabs images from video(4) devices and records them
to file, displays them using Xv(3), records and plays them concurrently,
and plays back recorded files.  video(1) can read from standard input
and write to standard output.  video(1) is also capable of setting some
of the controls on video(4) devices, such as brightness and contrast.

Should be part of xenocara, but does not build on gcc2.
