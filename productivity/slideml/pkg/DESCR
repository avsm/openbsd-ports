Slide Meta-Language (SlideML) is a simple to use meta-language to generate
presentation slides that can be viewed in a web browser.
The idea was to use ASCII-chat like tags that are translated into XHTML.
Joel Sing wrote the perl code that translates the meta-language into XHTML.
The JS, XSS & XHTML pieces were borrowed from Dave Raggett's HTML Slidy.

Generating a presentation is as simple as:
$ slideml.pl slides.sml > a.html
