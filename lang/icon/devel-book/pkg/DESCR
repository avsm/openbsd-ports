This is the reference book for the implementation of the Icon
programming language. Even though it was written for Icon 6,
it is still relevant to the current implementation.

This is a pdf document, so get a pdf viewer to use it.

This book is old enough to have been scanned off the printed material.
The resulting pdf is not of very high quality.
