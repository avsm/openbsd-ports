JVim is a text editor that is upwards compatible to vi. It can be used
to edit any ASCII and Japanese(EUC or JIS) text.  It is especially
useful for editing programs.

This package is built with Japanese support, using Wnn4 as default.

There are a lot of enhancements above vi: multi level undo, command
line editing, filename completion, on line help, quoting, etc.. Read
difference.doc for a summary of the differences between vi and Vim.
