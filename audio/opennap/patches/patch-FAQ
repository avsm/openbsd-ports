+Q:  What is a metaserver?  Do I need to run one?
+A:  A metaserver is a small server that attempts to provide load balancing
+    to a cluster of linked OpenNap servers.  You give it a list of all the
+    servers in your cluster, and it will cycle through the list each time
+    a connection is made.  Originally, the Napster client would connect to
+    the metaserver to find out which Napster server to connect to.
+    However, most clients these days just have support for a list of
+    servers to connect directly to, totally ignoring the metaserver.
+    Hence, running a metaserver is NOT required.
