WWW::Curl is a thin binding on top of libcurl, to make using libcurl
possible from Perl land. Because of this, the module is less like Perl
and more like C in coding style.

There is a new module, http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?WWW::Curl::Simple,
which wraps this module into a more Perlish and userfriendly package.

The standard Perl WWW module, LWP should probably be used in most cases
to work with HTTP or FTP from Perl. However, there are some cases where
LWP doesn't perform well. One is speed and the other is parallelism.
WWW::Curl is much faster, uses much less CPU cycles and it's capable of
non-blocking parallel requests.

In some cases, for example when building a web crawler, cpu usage and
parallel downloads are important considerations. It can be desirable to
use WWW::Curl to do the heavy-lifting of a large number of downloads and
wrap the resulting data into a Perl-friendly structure by HTTP::Response
or use WWW::Curl::Simple to do that for you.
