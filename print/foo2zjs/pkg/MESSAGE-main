USB printers must attach as a ugen(4) device which means you need to
disable ulpt(4) in your kernel - see config(8).
Your device will be available at /dev/ugenN.EE, where N is the device
number and EE its endoint.
e.g. lp=/dev/ugen0.02 for lpd(8) and usb:/dev/ugen0.02 for cupsd(8).

When using cupsd(8), the _cups user will need r/w access to the device.

Before using foo2zjs you should get extra files from the web, such as
.ICM profiles (for color correction) and firmware using the command
    ${PREFIX}/share/doc/foo2zjs/getweb

Then copy the downloaded file(s) into the corresponding directory under
    ${PREFIX}/share/foo2*

If your printer require a firmware load, run the following command as
root each time the device is powered up:
    cat ${PREFIX}/share/foo2zjs/firmware/XXX.dl > /dev/ugenN.EE
(where XXX is your printer firmware name)
You can use a hotplugd(8) attach script to make it automatic.
