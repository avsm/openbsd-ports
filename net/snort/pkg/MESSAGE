An up-to-date set of rules is needed for Snort to be useful as an IDS.
These can be downloaded manually or net/oinkmaster can be used to
download the latest rules from several different sources.

It is recommended that snort be run as an unprivileged chrooted user.
An _snort user/group and log directory has been created for this
purpose.  You should start snort with the following options to take
advantage of this:
	-u _snort -g _snort -t /var/snort
and if you want to log:
	-l /var/snort/log
