Zarafa webaccess has been installed under
${INSTDIR}

You should point the followings to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
   # ln -s ../zarafa-webaccess ${PREFIX}/htdocs/webaccess
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

You need to edit the config.php file installed under:
${INSTDIR} for regular web client access

You may want to edit ${PREFIX}/conf/php.ini according to
   ${INSTDIR}/.htaccess
In any case, short_open_tag must be "On".

If you want to debug the webaccess, copy the following file
   ${INSTDIR}/debug.php.disabled
to
   ${INSTDIR}/debug.php
The debugging output will then be available under:
   ${INSTDIR}/debug.txt
