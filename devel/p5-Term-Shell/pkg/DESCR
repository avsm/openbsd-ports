Term::Shell makes it joyfully easy to write command-line interfaces in
Perl. All the boring details like command-line parsing and terminal
handling are done for you.
For implementing a certain command ``foo'', you just have to
define subroutines run_foo, help_foo, smry_foo, comp_foo, each of them
doing the command itself, a help message, a short summary and
command completion.
