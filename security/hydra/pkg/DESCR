There are already several login hacker tools available, however none
supports multiple protocols nor parallelized connects.

This tool supports TELNET, FTP, POP3, IMAP, HTTP Basic and Cisco
authentication only, however the module engine for new services is very
simple, so it won't take long to add more services.  Planned are: SSH,
SAMBA, PCNFS, R-services, and more.  Additionally, password-only
protocols will be supported in the future: SNMP, RIP, OSPF and others.
