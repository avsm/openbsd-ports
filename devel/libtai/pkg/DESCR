libtai is a library for storing and manipulating dates and times.

libtai supports two time scales: (1) TAI64, covering a few hundred
billion years with 1-second precision; (2) TAI64NA, covering the
same period with 1-attosecond precision. Both scales are defined
in terms of TAI, the current international real time standard.

libtai provides an internal format for TAI64, struct tai, designed
for fast time manipulations. The tai_pack() and tai_unpack() routines
convert between struct tai and a portable 8-byte TAI64 storage
format. libtai provides similar internal and external formats for
TAI64NA.

libtai provides struct caldate to store dates in year-month-day
form. It can convert struct caldate, under the Gregorian calendar,
to a modified Julian day number for easy date arithmetic.

libtai provides struct caltime to store calendar dates and times
along with UTC offsets. It can convert from struct tai to struct
caltime in UTC, accounting for leap seconds, for accurate date and
time display. It can also convert back from struct caltime to struct
tai for user input. Its overall UTC-to-TAI conversion speed is 100x
better than the usual UNIX mktime() implementation.

The libtai source code is in the public domain.
