gedit is a small and lightweight UTF-8 text editor for the
GNOME environment.  gedit uses a Multiple Document Interface
(MDI), which lets you edit more than one document at the same time.

gedit supports most standard editing features, plus several not found
in your  average text editor (plugins being the most notable of these).
