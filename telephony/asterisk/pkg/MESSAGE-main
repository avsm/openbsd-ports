Simplified sample configuration is provided in ${SYSCONFDIR}/asterisk;
the full set is available in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/asterisk/default.

To have Asterisk start at boot time, you may insert the following
into /etc/rc.local:

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/safe_asterisk ]; then
        echo -n ' asterisk';   ${PREFIX}/sbin/safe_asterisk
fi

This uses safe_asterisk which monitors for abnormal termination
and restarts the daemon, and also creates the directory for the
control socket and pid file (by default, /var/run/asterisk).

If you prefer not to use safe_asterisk, you must create this
directory yourself since /var/run is cleared at boot.
