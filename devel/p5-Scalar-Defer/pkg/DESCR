This module exports two functions, "defer" and "lazy", for building
values that are evaluated on demand.
    
Unlike the "tie"-based Data::Lazy, this module operates on *values*, not
*variables*. Therefore, assigning into $dv and $lv above will simply
replace the value, instead of triggering a "STORE" method call.
