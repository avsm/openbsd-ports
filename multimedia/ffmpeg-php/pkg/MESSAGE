You can enable this module by creating a symbolic
link from ${PREFIX}/conf/php5.sample/ffmpeg.ini to
${PREFIX}/conf/php5/ffmpeg.ini.

ln -fs ${PREFIX}/conf/php5.sample/ffmpeg.ini \
        ${PREFIX}/conf/php5/ffmpeg.ini

If you already have Apache running on your machine,
you should not use "apachectl restart" - instead,
you should fully stop and then restart the server.
