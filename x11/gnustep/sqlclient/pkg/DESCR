The SQLClient library is designed to provide a simple interface to SQL
databases for GNUstep applications. It does not attempt the sort of
abstraction provided by the much more sophisticated GDL2 library but
rather allows applications to directly execute SQL queries and
statements.

SQLClient provides for the Objective-C programmer much the same thing
that JDBC provides for the Java programmer.
