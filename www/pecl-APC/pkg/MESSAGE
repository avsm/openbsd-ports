To finish the install of pecl-APC, you need
to enable the module by using the following command

    # ${LOCALBASE}/sbin/phpxs -a apc

If you already have Apache running on your machine,
you should not use "apachectl restart" - instead,
you should fully stop and then restart the server.

You'll also need to configure APC using various 
settings in php.ini.  See ${PREFIX}/pecl-APC/INSTALL
for details.
