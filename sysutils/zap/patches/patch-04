+.Sh NAME
+.Nm zap
+.Nd interactive process killer
+.Sh SYNOPSIS
+.Nm zap [-s NUM] [-y] string [...]]
+.Sh DESCRIPTION
+.Nm Zap
+takes one or more strings, looks for each in the output of a
+.Nm ps
+command that it runs, and for each process whose
+.Nm ps
+line matches the string, prints the line as a prompt.
+If you reply with a
+.Nm y,
+the program attempts to deliver a signal SIGERM to the given process.
+If a zero-length
+.Nm string
+is given, then every process will be prompted for.
+.PP
+The 
+.B -y
+option tells the program to just do it, not to ask for confirmation.
+It makes the program non-interactive.
+.PP
+The 
+.B -s
+.I signum
+option takes a numeric (only) argument, which is the signal number
+to send. In the absence of this option, SIGTERM is sent.
+.Sh EXAMPLES
+.Nm zap pppd
+.br
+Assuming you have permissions, will send a TERMinate signal to any and all 
+.Nm pppd
+processes.
+.Sh SEE ALSO
+.Nm ps(1)
+.Sh HISTORY
+The
+.Nm zap 
+command appears in the book 
+.Nm The UNIX Programming Environment,
+Kernighan and Pike, 1984, Prentice-Hall.
+.Sh AUTHORS
+Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike - program.
