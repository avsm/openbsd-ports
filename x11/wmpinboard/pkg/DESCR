wmpinboard is a Window Maker dock applet resembling a
miniature pinboard.  It's intended to somewhat relieve
heavily littered desktops by allowing you to place reminders
on a graphical on-screen pinboard rather than producing a
mess of real notes all around your keyboard.  It supports 
arbitrary 6x10 X fonts and has XLocale support, enabling you
to enter locale-dependent special characters if set up
appropriately.  Besides text, you can add small monochrome
sketches to your notes or simply encircle or underline words
as a means of emphasis, and alarms can be set to explicitly
remind you of things.  Above all, wmpinboard is animated in
redundant ways to make it look even more attractive, and
themeability provides for a way of adapting its appearance
to that of the rest of your desktop.
