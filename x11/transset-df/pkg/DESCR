transset-df is a heavily patched version of xorg's transset. It is used
to set the transparency of windows in X with the xcomposite extension.
It adds several command line options to make it easier to use directly,
bound to hot keys in your window manager, or through scripts. These
include the ability to select a window by window ID.
