Telepathy Inspector is a telepathy client (GTK+) whose objective is to
expose all interfaces and functionalities implemented by a given
connection manager along with its connections, channels, etc.

The idea is to enable the user (likely to be a Telepathy developer) to
easily view and access all methods and interfaces of all Telepathy
entities (CMs, connections, etc), which could not be easily achieved
using a regular telepathy client since it would (and should!) hide all
Telepathy logic behind a pleasant, usability oriented, GUI.
