  This is version 1.6.3 of the Cistron Radius daemon. Most of
  the code was taken from radius-1.16 by Livingston Enterprises,
  available from ftp.livingston.com.  It is taken from the 1.5.4.3
  release, with a few patches.

  The server is mostly compatible with livingston radiusd-2.01
  (no menus or s/key support though) but with more feautures, such as:

    o Can limit max. number of simultaneous logins on a per-user basis!
    o Multiple DEFAULT entries, that can optionally fall-through.
    o In fact, every entry can fall-through
    o Deny/permit access based on huntgroup users dials into
    o Set certain parameters (such as static IP address) based on huntgroup
    o Extra "hints" file that can select SLIP/PPP/rlogin based on
      username pattern (Puser or user.ppp is PPP, plain "user" is rlogin etc).
    o Can execute an external program when user has authenticated (for example
      to run a sendmail queue).
    o Can use `$INCLUDE filename' in users and dictionary files
    o Can act as a proxyerver, relaying requests to a remote server
    o Supports Vendor-Specific attributes
    o No good documentation at all, just like the original radiusd
