The GNOME Keyring Manager is an application for managing keyrings, in
which any kind of sensitive information can be kept, mainly passwords.
The default window shows 'default' keyrings with their stored items, and
allows addition, removal and edition.

Secrets can be copied using drag and drop, and can also be moved between
different keyrings. The manager also has creation, opening and
lock/unlock features.
