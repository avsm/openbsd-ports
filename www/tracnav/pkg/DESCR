The TracNav macro implements a fully customizable navigation bar
for the Trac wiki engine.

The contents of the navigation bar is a wiki page itself and can
be edited like any other wiki page through the web interface. The
navigation bar supports hierarchical ordering of topics.

The design of TracNav mimics the design of the TracGuideToc that
was originally supplied with Trac. The drawback of TracGuideToc is
that it is not customizable without editing its source code and
that it does not support hierarchical ordering.
