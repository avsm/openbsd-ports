Communication with the printer is done via CUPS over libusb, make sure
you read the OpenBSD specific documentation that comes with the cups
package to enable libusb support and disable ulpt(4) before using HPLIP.

To make the hpaio backend available to SANE, simply add "hpaio" to
its configuration file.  As root:
    echo "hpaio" >> ${SYSCONFDIR}/sane.d/dll.conf
