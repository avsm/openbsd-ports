dvd::rip is a full featured DVD copy program written in 
Perl. It provides an easy to use but feature-rich Gtk+ 
GUI to control almost all aspects of the ripping and 
transcoding process. It uses the widely known video 
processing swissknife transcode and many other 
Open Source tools.

dvd::rip has quite a few soft dependencies. Check
"Debug -> Check dependencies" in dvd::rip for details.
If operated in cluster mode, only transcode has to be
installed on all slave nodes, not dvd::rip itself.
