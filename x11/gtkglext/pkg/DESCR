GtkGLExt is an OpenGL extension to GTK+ 2.0 or later. It provides
additional GDK objects which support OpenGL rendering in GTK+, and
GtkWidget API add-ons to make GTK+ widgets OpenGL-capable.

Unlike GtkGLArea, GtkGLExt provides a GtkWidget API which enables OpenGL
drawing for standard and custom GTK+ widgets.
