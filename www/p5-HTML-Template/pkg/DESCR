This module attempts to make using HTML templates simple and natural.
It extends standard HTML with a few new HTML-esque tags. The file
written with HTML and these new tags is called a template. It is
usually saved separately from your script. Using this module you fill
in the values for the variables, loops and branches declared in the
template. This allows to separate design - the HTML - from the data,
which you generate in the Perl script.
