Your default datasize might not be enough for v8 so if you
experience the infamous "Aw, Snap!" error messages try to
raise your datasize limit to a higher value.
To set it to 715M you can do the following:

$ ulimit -d 716800

or modify /etc/login.conf.

And opening lots of tabs may necessitate higher fd limits,
crank that via ulimit/limits.
