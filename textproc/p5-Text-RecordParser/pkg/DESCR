Text::RecordParser  is used to read  record-oriented data in a delimited text
file. The most common example have records separated by newlines and
fields separated by commas or tabs, but this module aims at providing a
consistent interface for handling sequential records in a file in more
generality.  Typically the first record lists the field names,
in which case you should call "bind_header" to bind the field names.
If the first line contains data, you can still bind your own field names via
"bind_fields". In both cases, you may afterwards use many methods to get 
at the data as arrays or hashes.
