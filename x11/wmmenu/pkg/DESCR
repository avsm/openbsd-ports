A dockapp for Window Maker that provides a pop-up menu of icons
that launch applications, like in AfterStep.  The program can be
run more than once at the same time, which allows many different
menus, each one described in a separate file.

Read ${PREFIX}/share/doc/wmmenu/README for info on configuring this
dockapp.

The gdk-pixbuf flavor allows you to use other icons than XPM format
