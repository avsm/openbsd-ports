Using BuildBot slave in an OpenBSD environment
==============================================

On OpenBSD, the BuildBot package has an associated _buildslave user
for running the slave.  The default slave directory is expected to be
found in ${HOMEDIR}.  Before being run for the first time, the
slave directory must be initialized.  This is done as follows:

    $ sudo -u _buildslave buildslave \
        create-slave ${HOMEDIR} <master> <name> <passwd>
