Hping is a software to do TCP/IP stack auditing, to uncover firewall
policy, to scan TCP port in a lot of different modes, to transfer
files accross a firewall and many other stuff. Using hping you are
able to do a lot of not security-regarding stuff. For example you
can test networks performance, check if a host is up, check if TOS
is handled et cetera.
