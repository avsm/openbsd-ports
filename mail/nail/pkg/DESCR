Nail is a mail user agent derived from Berkeley Mail 8.1 and contains
builtin support for MIME messages.  This means it can handle international
character sets as well as attachments.  In recent system environments, nail
is Unicode/UTF-8 capable.  It further contains some minor enhancements like
the ability to set a From: Address.
