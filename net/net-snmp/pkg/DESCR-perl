Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely used protocol for
monitoring the health of network equipment (eg. routers), computer equipment
and even devices like UPSs. Net-SNMP is a suite of applications used to
implement SNMP v1, SNMP v2c and SNMP v3 using both IPv4 and IPv6.

This package provides Perl bindings to the Net-SNMP library.
