This is a minimal screen scraping interface to the Drupal admin pages.
Its primary purpose (at the moment) is to provide a means to automate
drupal core upgrades.

Most of the methods in this class depend on English strings from the
pages' value fields, because WWW::Mechanize doesn't use id fields as
selectors. Thus, this module will most likely not work for sites with
a backend set to any non-English language.
