.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a lightweight tool that generates heavily fragmented I/O.
It accomplishes this by forking a number of children that run I/O to a
filesystem.
.Pp
This tool is intended to test storage stacks under stress and worst case
scenarios.
However due to heavy fragmentation of the I/O files,
it tends to bypass caching algorithms in storage stacks.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar max-io-size
This is the fixed I/O size unless the -r flag is set.
The default is 64KB.
.It Fl d Ar target-directory
This is the directory where the I/O file will be written to.
The default is the current working directory.
.It Fl f Ar result-directory
This is the directory where the result file will be written to.
The result file is updated every
.Ar update-time
seconds with statistics.
The default is the current working directory.
.It Fl k
Kill all running
.Nm
processes.
.It Fl n Ar nr-forks
This will determine how many identical processes will be forked to run I/O.
The default is 1.
.It Fl p Ar read-percentage
This determins the read vs write distribution.
The range is from 10% to 90%.
The default is 50.
.It Fl P Ar pattern
Pattern is a whole number that designates the IO pattern.  The default is a
text pattern that is human readable.  Use ? to print out the available
patterns.
.It Fl r
Randomize I/O size between 1 and
.Ar max-io-size .
Enabling this flag will disable data verification.
The default is disabled.
.It Fl s Ar max-file-size
The file where the I/O is run to and from will grow sequentially until it is
bigger or equal to this value.
At that point all write I/O will also become random.
The default is 1GB.
.It Fl t Ar update-time
This determines the minimal amount of time between updates.
Under heavy I/O this value can be skewed due to
the asynchronous nature of
.Xr alarm 3 .
The default is 60 seconds.
.El
.Pp
Although the algorithm for I/O generation is incredibly simple,
it has proven to be very effective at
bringing out issues in storage stacks.
It first grows the initial file a minimal amount to be able to start running
I/O in it.
After the initial growth,
it reads randomly within the current file size.
Every run is a distribution between reads and writes which is governed by
the read percentage value.
The file is grown sequentially until it reaches maximum file size.
Whenever this happens a message is logged to syslogd(8) and all writes become
random.
.Pp
To monitor progress one can
.Xr tail 1
the result file which is updated every
.Ar update-time
interval or send the process a
.Dv HUP
signal.
Whenever an I/O process receives a
.Dv HUP
signal, it prints statistical values to
.Xr stderr 4
at its earliest convenience.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Run iogen with all defaults in the current working directory:
.Pp
.Dl $ iogen
.Pp
Run
.Nm
with all defaults and a 1 second result file update:
.Pp
.Dl $ iogen -t 1
.Pp
Run
.Nm
with a 2GB max file, 128KB I/O size, and result file in
.Pa /tmp :
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ iogen -s 2g -b 128k -t 1 -f /tmp
.Ed
.Sh HISTORY
The first version of
.Nm
was written in 2005.

.Sh CAVEATS
This tool is capable of running extremely heavy I/O.
It is known to have broken hardware before so please use caution and don't
complain if something bad happens.
