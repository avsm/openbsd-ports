ffmpeg-php is an extension for PHP that adds an easy to use,
object-oriented API for accessing and retrieving information from video
and audio files.  It has methods for returning frames from movie files
as images that can be manipulated using PHP's image functions.  This
works well for automatically creating thumbnail images from movies.
ffmpeg-php is also useful for reporting the duration and bitrate of
audio files (mp3, wma, etc).  ffmpeg-php can access many of the video
formats supported by ffmpeg (mov, avi, mpg, wmv, etc).
