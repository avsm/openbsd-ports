The purpose of OpRoute is to attempt to establish a
*generalized* measurement system which takes into
account all of the factors that are usually considered
to be important when it comes to performance.
Specifically:

 - Packet Loss 
 - Latency 
 - Layer 3 Hops 
 - AS Hops 
 - NAP Hops 
 - Throughput (To be done, not in there yet)
