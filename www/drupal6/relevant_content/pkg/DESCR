This module provides two ways of referencing relevant content. Both of
these methods provide configuration to filter for specific content types
and vocabularies, limit the maximum size of the result and provide some
header text. The result on both cases are a list of nodes which the
module considers most relevant based on the categorization of the
current page. This is achieved by finding other nodes which are of one
of the allowed types and have the most number of terms in common.
