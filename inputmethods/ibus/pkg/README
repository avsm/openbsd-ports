To make IBus work when X is started add the following lines to
~/.xinitrc or ~/.xsession:

    export GTK_IM_MODULE="ibus"
    export QT_IM_MODULE="ibus"
    export XMODIFIERS="@im=ibus"
    ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/ibus-daemon -d -x -r

To use IBus within xterm(1) the character locale needs to be UTF-8.
For example to set it to US English in UTF-8 mode, also add:

    export LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8

Finally, to display characters correctly make sure to use a Unicode
(ISO-10646-1) font.

To activate IBus press Ctrl+Space.  For general configuration,
including hotkeys:

    $ ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/ibus-setup
