The QEMU Accelerator (KQEMU) is a driver allowing a user application to
run x86 code in a Virtual Machine (VM). The code can be either user or
kernel code, in 64, 32 or 16 bit protected mode.

It can execute code from many guest OSes (e.g. Linux, Windows 2000/XP)
even if the host CPU does not support hardware virtualization.
