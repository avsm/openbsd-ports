Ion is a new kind of window manager that brings a text-editorish, keyboard
friendly user interface to window management.

Ion simply divides the screen into frames that take the whole screen. Big
displays have so much space that this is convenient and smaller displays
couldn't show more than one window at a time anyway. The frames can be split and
growing the size of one will shrink others.  As in PWM, clients can be moved
between frames and multiple clients can be attached to one frame.

This is the development version of the Ion window manager.
