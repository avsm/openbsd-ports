Common Lisp is a high-level, all-purpose, object-oriented,
dynamic, functional programming language.

CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible of
Karlsruhe University and Michael Stoll of Munich University,
both in Germany.  It mostly supports the Lisp described in the
ANSI Common Lisp standard.

CLISP includes an interpreter, a compiler, a large subset of
CLOS, a foreign language interface, and a socket interface.
An X11 interface is available through CLX and Garnet.  Command
line editing is provided by readline.

CLISP is free software and may be distributed under the terms
of the GNU GPL.  You may distribute commercial applications
compiled with CLISP, see file COPYRIGHT in the CLISP distribution.

The user interface comes in German, English, French, Spanish
and Dutch, and can be changed at run time.
