Before using xmcd/cda for the first time, you must
set up the software by running the following program:

      ${PREFIX}/sbin/xmcdconfig

Xmcd/cda will not work until that is done.

You may also want to set up cron(8) to run the
${PREFIX}/share/xmcd/scripts/genidx script periodically
(e.g., nightly) to re-generate the local discography
category index pages.
