Simplejson is a simple, fast, extensible JSON encoder/decoder for
Python.  It is compatible with Python 2.3 and later with no external
dependencies. It covers the full JSON specification for both encoding
and decoding, with unicode support.  The encoder may be subclassed
to provide serialization in any kind of situation, without any
special support by the objects to be serialized (somewhat like
pickle).  The decoder can handle incoming JSON strings of any
specified encoding.
