BZFlag is an Open Source OpenGL multiplayer multiplatform Battle Zone
capture the Flag game.  At its heart, the game is a 3D first person
tank simulation where opposing teams battle for dominance.  The game
was originally written for SGI computers running Irix, but now runs
and is actively maintained on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, BSD, Solaris,
and other platforms.  The game is distributed under the LGPL license.

This is the BZFlag README file.  This file includes introductory build
instructions, user community interaction references, information for
getting involved in BZFlag development, a manifest of the source code
layout, basic usage expectations, contact information, and more.

If your system does not have hardware-accelerated OpenGL, you
may wish to consider adding this line:

	set useBitmapFontRenderer 1

to your configuration file (~/.bzf/2.0/config.cfg), to improve
your framerate considerably.
