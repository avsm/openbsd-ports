+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that to produce graphs the py-dot package needs to be installed;
the dependency is not enforced because it requires graphviz which
depends on lots of graphical packages.

Before starting the trytond server, several steps are required.

Configuration
=============
Edit ${SYSCONFDIR}/trytond.conf based on your configuration and needs.
The "db_password" and "admin_passwd" MUST be changed.

PostgreSQL
==========
Trytond uses a PostgreSQL database to store its data. Dependency is not
enforced because the database can run on another machine.

Assuming you have an administrative account named `postgres', you can
create the 'tryton' user like this:
    # createuser -U postgres --pwprompt --no-superuser --createdb \
        --no-createrole tryton

Make sure to set the 'tryton' DB user password to the value of
"db_password" in ${SYSCONFDIR}/trytond.conf.

First start
===========
Start the trytond server:
    # /etc/rc.d/trytond start

Database initialization
-----------------------
There are 2 ways to initialize the 'tryton' database.

1. Start directly the tryton client, then go under:
    File -> Database -> New Database
to initialise your new DB.

2. Manually initialize the DB on the server itself:
    # createdb -U postgres -E UNICODE -O tryton -T template0 tryton
    # trytond -i all -d tryton

When the "Admin Password Confirmation" is requested, make sure to match
the value of "admin_passwd" in ${SYSCONFDIR}/trytond.conf.

The /var/log/trytond file can grow very marge with time, it is advised
to use newsyslog(8) to rotate it.

Modules installation
====================
Several trytond-module packages are available in OpenBSD. Just running
pkg_add(1) is not enough, they need to get installed into the database
itself.
    # trytond -i all -d tryton

This can instead be done directly from the tryton client as well if
prefered.

Upgrades
========
After upgrading to a new major version of trytond, the database needs to
be updated.
    # trytond -u all -d tryton
