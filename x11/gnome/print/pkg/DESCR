Gnome-print is a high-quality printing framework for GNOME. 

Gnome-print implements: 

* device-independent printing API, modelled loosely after
  PostScript language.

* font abstraction that allows device-independent text
  display (within reasonable limits).

* powerful configuration engine, dealing with all levels
  of output pipeline set of actual printer drivers
  (PostScript, PDF, fax).

* print preview widget.

* printer selector widget.
