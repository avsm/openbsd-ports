 =======================
 KAFFE OpenVM 1.0 Beta 1
 =======================

This is the first release of "Kaffe OpenVM", a complete virtual machine
and class library set which allows the execution of Java code without any
code from Javasoft.  It comes with a virtual machine and a set of class
libraries including beans, and the all important AWT graphics system.
This is the first full JDK1.1 release of the runtime, and also includes
a compiler (javac-compatible).

This is beta software and, in particular, has numerous minor glitches.
However it can run enough JDK1.1-compatible programs that I am
releasing it into the Ports tree for others to experiment with.
We are keeping it separate from the Kaffe-0.8.* which will be maintained
in ports/lang/kaffe for people who need JDK-1.0 compatability.
