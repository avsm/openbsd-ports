nfprofile is a netflow profiler, which works with the nfdump tools.
It reads the netflow data from the files stored by nfcapd, filters
the netflow data according to the specified filter sets (profiles)
and stores the filtered data into files for later use.

nftrack is prototype software normally distributed with the NfSen
PortTracker plugin; it's included here as it depends on nfdump
sources. In combination with PortTracker it allows tracking of
each TCP/UDP port to provide insight into the activity observed
on the most active ports.
