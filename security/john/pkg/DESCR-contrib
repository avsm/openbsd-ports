John the Ripper -- Password Cracker
=====================================

John the Ripper is designed to be both powerful and fast. It combines
several cracking modes in one program, and is fully configurable for your
particular needs (you can even define a custom cracking mode using the
built-in compiler supporting a subset of C).

Out of the box, John supports (and autodetects) the following ciphertext
formats: standard and double-length DES-based, BSDI's extended DES-based,
FreeBSD's (and not only) MD5-based and OpenBSD's Blowfish-based.

With just one extra command (required to extract the passwords), John can
crack AFS passwords and WinNT LM hashes.

Unlike other crackers, John doesn't use a crypt(3)-style routine. Instead,
it has its own highly optimized modules for different ciphertext formats
and architectures. Some of the algorithms used couldn't be implemented in
a crypt(3)-style routine: they require a more powerful interface (bitslice
DES is an example). Additionally, there're assembly routines for several
processors and architectures (special Intel Pentium version, x86 with MMX,
generic x86, Alpha EV4, SPARC V8).

This version integrates lots of contributed patches adding support for over 40
of additional hash and cipher types (including popular ones such as NTLM,
raw MD5, etc.), as well as some optimizations and features.
