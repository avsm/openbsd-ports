Pango is a library for laying out and rendering text, with an emphasis
on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is
needed, but using Pango in conjunction with Cairo and/or Gtk2 provides a
complete solution with high quality text handling and graphics rendering.
This package contains the Perl bindings for Pango.
