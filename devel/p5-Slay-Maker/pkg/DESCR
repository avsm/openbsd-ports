Slay::Maker is a make engine that uses perl declaration syntax for
rules, including regular expressions for targets and anonymous subs for
targets, dependencies, and actions.

This allows you to tightly integrate a make engine in an application and
to exercise a large amount of control over the make process, taking full
advantage of Perl code at any point in the make cycle.
