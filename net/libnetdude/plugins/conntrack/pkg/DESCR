This plugin implements control blocks for connections running over IP.
The semantics of "connection" depend on the transport protocol: the
plugin models TCP connection endpoints using a TCP connection state
machine, UDP and other protocols are supported by a timeout mechanism.
The plugin provides connection tables to store and retrieve connections
conveniently. Please have a look at the README for more details.
