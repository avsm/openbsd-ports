Pinot is a D-Bus service that crawls, indexes your documents and
monitors them for changes, with a GTK-based user interface that enables
to query the index built by the service or your favourite Web engine,
and display and analyze the results.

If you have the deskbar-applet package installed, you will be able to
use the pinot-live.py or pinot-module.py plugins from the applet.
