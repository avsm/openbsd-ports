Java (TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition
Version 1.3.1

The Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment contains the Java virtual machine,
runtime class libraries, and Java application launcher that are
necessary to run programs written in the Java programming language.
It is not a development environment and does not contain development
tools such as compilers and debuggers.  For development tools, use
the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition. 

Flavors:
  native_bootstrap
    Bootstrap the jdk using a previously built and installed           
    devel/jdk/1.3 package. NOTE: if this flavor is used without a
    previously installed devel/jdk/1.3 package, the port will
    build the jdk twice!
