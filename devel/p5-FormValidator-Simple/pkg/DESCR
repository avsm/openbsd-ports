This module provides you with form data validation through simple
constraints chains. You can write constraints on a single line for each
input data.

The idea is based on Sledge::Plugin::Validator, and most of the validation
code is borrowed from this plugin (Sledge is a MVC web application framework: 
http://sl.edge.jp [Japanese])
