BackupPC is a high-performance, enterprise-grade system for backing
up Linux, WinXX, and MacOS PCs and laptops to a server's disk.
BackupPC is highly configurable and easy to install and maintain.

Given the ever decreasing cost of disks and raid systems, it is now
practical and cost effective to backup a large number of machines onto
a server's local disk or network storage. This is what BackupPC does.
For some sites, this might be the complete backup solution. For other
sites, additional permanent archives could be created by periodically
backing up the server to tape.  A variety of Open Source systems are
available for doing backup to tape.

BackupPC is written in Perl and extracts backup data via rsync, or tar
over ssh/rsh/nfs.  It is robust, reliable, well documented and freely
available as Open Source on SourceForge.
