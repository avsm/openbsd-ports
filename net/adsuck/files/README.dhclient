To make dhclient play nice with adsuck, patching dhclient-script is necessary:

 cd /sbin
 patch -p0 < ${LOCALBASE}/share/adsuck/dhclient-script.diff

Be sure to put:

 adsuck_flags="-c /var/adsuck -f /files/resolv.conf /files/hosts.small"

in ${SYSCONFDIR}/rc.conf.local.

Also, be sure to set ${SYSCONFDIR}/resolv.conf to contain only one
nameserver line:

  nameserver 127.0.0.1
