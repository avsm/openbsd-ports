This module provides a convenient, object-oriented interface to
Apache-style .htpasswd files. It supports passwords encrypted via MD5,
SHA1, and crypt, as well as plain (cleartext) passwords. It requires
Crypt::PasswdMD5 for MD5 and Digest::SHA1 for SHA1. Additional fields
after username and password, if present, are accessible via the
extra_info array.
