Mozilla Thunderbird is a redesign of the integrated Mozilla App-Suite
mail component. Its goal is to leverage much of the existing
functionality of that product to produce a stand-alone mail application
that is simple and extensible.

Thunderbird looks for plugins in ~/.mozilla/plugins
${LOCALBASE}/mozilla-thunderbird/plugins
and ${LOCALBASE}/lib/mozilla-plugins.

To disable anti-aliasing (xft) altogether set GDK_USE_XFT=0 in the
environment.
