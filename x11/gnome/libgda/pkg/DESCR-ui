Libgda UI extension builds on top of Libgda and GTK+ to provide some
graphical widgets, a control center (to manage DSN and list installed
providers) and a browser program to analyze the contents of a database.
   
Libgda UI's components are:
    * the runtime files (shared library)
    * the GObject introspection files (to be used by the GObject
      introspection framework)
    * the tools, which require the runtime component
    * the development files (the includes to compile C programs)
