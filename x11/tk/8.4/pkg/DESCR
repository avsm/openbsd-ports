This is Tk version 8.4, a GUI toolkit for Tcl. It provides the means 
to write simple scripts to create and manipulate X window system 
windows with the various manipulators available in X11 libraries.

The best way to get started with Tcl and Tk is to read ``Tcl and the Tk
Toolkit'' by John K. Ousterhout, Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-63337-X.

A full set of manual pages is also provided with this package.
