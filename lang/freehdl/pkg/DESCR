FreeHDL is a compiler/simulator suite for the hardware description
language VHDL.  VHDL'93 as well as VHDL'87 standards are supported.

FreeHDL translates the original VHDL source FILEs into C++. Then, the
C++ source can be compiled and linked to the kernel to build the
simulation program. Starting the generated executable will simulate the
corresponding VHDL model. The actual build process to generate the
simulator from the VHDL source is a complex process which is handled by
the gvhdl script.
