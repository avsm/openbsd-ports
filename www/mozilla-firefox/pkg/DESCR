The Mozilla Firefox project is a redesign of Mozilla's browser
component, written using the XUL user interface language and designed
to be cross-platform.

Firefox looks for plugins in ~/.mozilla/plugins
${LOCALBASE}/mozilla-firefox/plugins
and ${LOCALBASE}/lib/mozilla-plugins.

To disable anti-aliasing (xft) altogether set GDK_USE_XFT=0 in the
environment.

Known problems:
- Extensions do not work.
