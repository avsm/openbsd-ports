This module combines WWW::Mechanize and HTML::TreeBuilder. Why? Because
I've seen too much code like the following:

 like($mech->content, qr{<p>some text</p>}, "Found the right tag");

Which is just all flavours of wrong - its akin to processing XML with
regexps.  Instead, do it like the following:

 ok($mech->look_down(_tag => 'p', sub { $_[0]->as_trimmed_text eq 'some
 text' })

The anon-sub there is a bit icky, but this means that anyone should
happen to add attributes to the <p> tag (such as an id or a class) it
will still work and find the right tag.
