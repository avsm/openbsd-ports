Password Manager helps to manage large numbers of passwords and related
information and simplifies the tasks of searching and entering password
data.

KedPM is written as an extensible framework, which allows users to plug
in custom password database back-ends and custom user interface
front-ends. Currently, only the Figaro PM back-end supported. To control
KedPM user can choose between CLI and GTK2 based GUI front-ends.
