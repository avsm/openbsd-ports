+.SH NAME
+idiff \- interactive diff of two files
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B idiff
+file1 file2
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.I Idiff
+runs
+.IR diff (1)
+on the specified files and then
+presents each chunk of
+.I diff
+output and offers the user the option of
+choosing the ``from'' part or the ``to'' part,
+or editing the parts.
+.I Idiff
+produces the selected pieces in the proper order in a file called
+.IR idiff.out .

+will prompt the user (with a `? ')
+for a command.
+The valid commands are:

+.B <
+Take the ``from'' portion of the displayed chunk.
+This is the portion which
+was extracted from the first file specified.

+This corresponds to that
+extracted from the second file specified.
+.TP
+.B e
+Invoke an editor on the chunk.

+The default is
+.IR /bin/ed .

+will be placed into the final output.
