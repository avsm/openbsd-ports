To start memcached at boot time, add the following to /etc/rc.local:

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/bin/memcached ]; then
        echo -n ' memcached'
        ${PREFIX}/bin/memcached -d \
           -u _memcached -P /var/run/memcached.pid
fi

To see further configuration options, run "memcached -h".

Since memcached has no authentication mechanisms, it is designed for
internal use only, and should be firewalled accordingly. You may wish
to add a rule such as the following to /etc/pf.conf:

  block on $ext_if proto tcp to ($ext_if) port 11211
