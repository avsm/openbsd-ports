Xwrits reminds you to take wrist breaks for prevention or management of
repetitive stress injuries.  When you should take a break, it pops up an
X window, the warning window.  You click on the warning window, then
take a break.  The window changes appearance while you take the break.
It changes again when your break is over.  Then you just resume typing.
Xwrits hides itself until you should take another break.
