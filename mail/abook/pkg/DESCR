Addressbook program with mutt mail client support.

abook uses curses libs and is able to import addressbooks from
pine and netscape (ldif).
Exports to mutt alias, html, pine, gcrd (GnomeCard), csv, elm 
alias, and plain text.

It is nice for querying from within mutt; to use it as such, add
the following to your muttrc:
set query_command="${PREFIX}/bin/abook --mutt-query '%s'"
