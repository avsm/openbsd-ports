xjobs reads job descriptions line by line and executes them in parallel.
xjobs is most useful on multiprocessor machines when one needs to
execute several time consuming commands that could possibly be run in
parallel. It works similar to xargs, but starts several processes
simultaneously and gives only one line of arguments to each utility
call.
