You appear to already have a mysql database directory in /var/db/mysql.

In order to preserve your existing data, you should:
	- dump all your databases
	- kill mysql if it is running
	- delete the /var/db/mysql directory
	- run 'make install'
	- start up mysql
	- re-create all of your database
	- re-load your data

If you understand the consequences of this upgrade, please re-build this
port with the environment variable OVERWRITE_DB defined.

END
