Once you have the config files under ${SYSCONFDIR}/nut set up properly, the
following block can be added to your /etc/rc.local file to start nut.

# Start Nut
if [ -x ${PREFIX}/bin/upsdrvctl ]; then
    echo -n ' nut'
    ${PREFIX}/bin/upsdrvctl start > /dev/null 2>&1
    ${PREFIX}/sbin/upsd > /dev/null 2>&1
    ${PREFIX}/sbin/upsmon > /dev/null 2>&1
fi

The userid running NUT (normally ${NUT_USER}) must have access to the relevant
device nodes. For a UPS connected by RS232, either add ${NUT_USER} to group
"dialer" or change group of the relevant /dev/tty* device to ${NUT_USER}.
For a USB-connected UPS, change the group of the relevant /dev/ugen* and
/dev/usb* devices to ${NUT_USER}; to identify the specific controller and
ugen device names, use "sudo usbdevs -vd".
