Real Mah Jongg is a social game that originated in China thousands
of years ago. Four players, named after the four winds, take tiles
from a wall in turn. The best tiles are made of ivory and wood;
they click pleasantly when you knock them together.

The object is to remove all Mah Jongg tiles from the playing field
by taking one matching pair at a time. Generally, two tiles match
if they have identical pictures on top. There are some exceptions:
any season tile (spring, summer, autumn, or winter) matches any
other season, and any flower tile (bamboo, orchid, plum, or
chrysanthemum) matches any other flower. There are 144 tiles in all
-- one of each season and flower, and four copies of each of the
following: 1 to 9 dots; 1 to 9 bamboo sticks; characters for 1 to
9; the four winds (north, south, east, and west); and three dragons
(red, green, and white).
