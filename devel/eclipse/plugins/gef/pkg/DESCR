The Graphical Editing Framework (GEF) allows developers to create a rich
graphical editor from an existing application model. GEF is completely
application neutral and provides the groundwork to build almost any
application, including but not limited to: flow builders, GUI builders,
UML diagram editors (such as work-flow and class modeling diagrams), and
even WYSIWYG text editors like HTML.
