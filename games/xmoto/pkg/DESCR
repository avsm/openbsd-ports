X-Moto is a challenging 2D motocross platform game, where physics plays
an all important role in the gameplay. You need to control your bike to
its limits, if you want to have a chance to finish the most difficult
challenges.

If your system does not have hardware-accelerated OpenGL, you may wish 
to run the game in "ugly" mode:

xmoto --ugly

This will increase the framerate significantly, sacrificing the game's
eyecandy graphics.
