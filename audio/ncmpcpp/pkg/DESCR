Ncmpcpp or ncmpc++ is a mpd client with a UI very similar to ncmpc, but
it provides new useful features such as support for regular expressions
in the search engine, extended song format, items filtering, last.fm
support, ability to sort playlists, local filesystem browser and other
minor functions.
