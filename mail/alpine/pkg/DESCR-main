Alpine is a screen-oriented message-handling tool.  In its default
configuration, Alpine offers an intentionally limited set of functions
geared toward the novice user, but it also has a large list of optional
"power-user" and personal-preference features.

An optional configuration file "pine.conf" can be put into /etc to set
system wide defaults.  The format of this file is identical to the .pinerc
file that is auto-generated by Alpine in your home directory.

Available flavors:
	ldap - Build with support for LDAP
