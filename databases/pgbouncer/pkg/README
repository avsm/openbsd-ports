1) Carefully edit ${SYSCONFDIR}/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.ini and 
   ${SYSCONFDIR}/pgbouncer/userlist.txt to fit your needs.


2) Launch pgbouncer in foreground mode to see if everything 
   is ok:

   # install -d -o _pgbouncer /var/run/pgbouncer
   # pgbouncer -u _pgbouncer ${SYSCONFDIR}/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.ini


3) Add the following to your /etc/rc.local:

   if [ -x ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/pgbouncer ]; then
	echo -n 'pgbouncer'
	install -d -o _pgbouncer /var/run/pgbouncer
	${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/pgbouncer -d -u _pgbouncer \
		${SYSCONFDIR}/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.ini
   fi



Random hints: 

  * Check /var/log/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.log if something 
    goes wrong
