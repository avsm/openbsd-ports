Rarian is a documentation metadata library based on the proposed
Freedesktop.org Help System spec. Rarian is designed to be a replacement
for scrollkeeper.

Rarian manages documentation metadata (as specified by the Open Source
Metadata Framework (OMF) and provides a simple API to allow help
browsers to find, sort, and search the document catalog. It will also be
able to communicate with catalog servers on the Net to search for
documents which are not on the local system.
