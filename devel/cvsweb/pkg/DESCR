The cvsweb WWW CGI script allows remote users to browse a CVS
repository tree via the web.  It can display the revision history
of a file, as well as diffs between revisions, and download the
whole file.

The cvsweb script has been written by Bill Fenner <fenner@FreeBSD.org>
for the FreeBSD project, improved visually and functionally by Henner
Zeller <zeller@think.de>, Henrik Nordstrom <hno@hem.passagen.se>, and
Ken Coar <Ken.Coar@Golux.Com>, to be adopted by the NetBSD project.

Akinori MUSHA <knu@FreeBSD.org> is adding more enhancements and doing
some cleanups over Zeller's version.
