Some OpenBSD platforms ship with a slightly modified gcc 2.95.3, other
ship with a modified gcc 3.3.5.

This port is an almost carbon-copy of the compiler in-tree, with a few
differences:

- it's taken off a more recent snapshot from gcc 3.3 branch.

- it's not the system compiler, and so it looks for includes in /usr/local,
and for libraries in /usr/local/lib.

- it can bootstrap itself fully, including ada on i386, and java (though
java does not yet work. There's an issue with boehm-gc).

- it may build on platforms for which system gcc is still 2.95.3.

There are other gcc ports in the tree, all of them correspond to more
recent branches of gcc (at least 3.4 and 4.0 as of this writing). They
may or may not build on your platform.
