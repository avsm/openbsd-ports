The Enhanced VNC viewer provides for remote access to VNC displays
using the standard protocol and various extensions including those used
by TightVNC, UltraVNC, RealVNC and x11vnc providing for features such
as dynamic screen resizing, server-side scaling, blocking input devices
on the server, and low colour modes. Many of these can now be set from
the popup menu.
