LDAP support with group management has been added as a Trac extension.
This extension enables to use existing LDAP groups to grant permissions
rather than defining permissions for every single user on the system.
The latest release also permits to store permissions (both users and
groups permissions) in the LDAP directory itself rather than in the
SQL backend.
