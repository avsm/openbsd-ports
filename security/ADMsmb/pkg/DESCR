[* Story *]

Well when I started to port ADMhack to libc6,
I thought of putting in some extra functionality.
Well, in effect, I've totally rewritten the samba test function. :)
I was thinking about NAT (from SECNET), which is a great tool.
But it fails sometimes, and is not very fast.
But ADMsmb is NOT NAT !  I wrote my own program for Samba (coded in one
day), so if you find a bug, pitty me. :)

[* description *]

ADM smb is a security scanner for Samba 
/* based on the src of the smbclient  from the samba team */
ADMsmb will perform a complete audit of samba for you on a host you
provide.

[* general *]

1: Get the netbios name of the machine
2: Give you information about this machine 
  {
    share list;
    workgroup;
    domain;
    os;
   }

3: try to access any shares exported 
4: perform a session brute force  
5: perform brute force on a directory specified.

[* Bug!   *]  
no bug reported at this time 

[* feature *]

multi socket brute force
Xwin interface ?
