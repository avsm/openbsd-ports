FooBillard is a free OpenGL-billard game for Linux with realistic
physics, AI-player and many gametypes like pool carambol or snooker. Why
foo? Well, actually I had this logo (F.B.-Florian Berger) and then foo
sounds a bit like pool (Somehow I wasn't quite attracted by the name
FoolBillard) The main physics is quite mature but not yet perfect. If
you are a billard-pro and you're missing some physics, please tell me.
Cause I've implemented it like I think it should work, which might
differ from reality.
