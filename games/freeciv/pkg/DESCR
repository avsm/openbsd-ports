Freeciv is a turn-based strategy game, in which each player becomes
the leader of a civilization, fighting to obtain the ultimate goal:
the extinction of all other civilizations.  Freeciv aims to be
mostly rule-compatible with Civilization II, published by Sid Meier
and Microprose.

FreeCiv comes without sound sets.  You can get them from:
  ftp://ftp.freeciv.org/freeciv/contrib/sounds/
and then start civclient with:
  -P sound_plugin_name -S /sound/spec/file
E.g.: civclient -P sdl -S /home/deraadt/civsounds/file.spec
(Note: Sound specs might have relative paths.)

Flavors:
 * gtk - build UI using GTK widgets
 * sdl - sound support using SDL library
 * esd - sound support using ESD library
