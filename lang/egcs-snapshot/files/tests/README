testing procedure: 
- obtain a RECENT snapshot of dejagnu from egcs.cygnus.com.
I've used dejagnu-980528 for my tests. Installation should be easy.
It was almost a drop-in for dejagnu-1.3 in my case.
- make build should now BOTH build the snapshot AND build the checks.
You will also find a `warnings' file in the work/egcs-* directory...
- have a look at work/source/contrib... this is what you need to analyze
the test results.

OpenBSD notes:
* we are trying to use BSD make instead of gnu-make. A large proportion
of the patches are used for that. They have been reported to cygnus, and
will probably be unnecessary soon.
* you need an up-to-date bsd.port.mk.
* an assembler bug that affects the sparc has been fixed post-2.4. It may
affect other architectures.

To run the same testsuites under native gcc 2.8.1:
- move the site.exp file elsewhere, edit it to get the right paths.
- remove the -Os option from the various testsuite drivers, gcc 2.8.1 
does not support -Os...
- run with e.g., GCC=/usr/bin/gcc runtest --tool gcc
