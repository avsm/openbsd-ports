re2c is a tool for writing very fast and very flexible scanners.
re2c focuses on generating high efficient code for regular expression
matching. As a result this allows a much broader range of use than
any traditional lexer offers. And last but not least re2c generates
warning free code that is equal to hand-written code in terms of
size, speed and quality.
