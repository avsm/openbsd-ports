Net::SFTP is a pure-Ruby implementation of the SFTP protocol.
That's "SFTP" as in "Secure File Transfer Protocol", as defined as
an adjuct to the SSH specification.  _Not_ "SFTP" as in "Secure FTP"
(a _completely_ different beast).  Nor is it an implementation of
the "Simple File Transfer Protocol" (which is in no way secure).
