This package consists of encoding files for use with poppler.  The
encoding files are optional and poppler will automatically read
them if they are present.  When installed, the encoding files enables
poppler to correctly render CJK and Cyrrilic properly.  While poppler
is licensed under the GPL, these encoding files are copyright Adobe
and licensed much more strictly, and thus distributed separately.
