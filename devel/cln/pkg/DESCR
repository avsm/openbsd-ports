CLN is a C++ library providing the following features:

 * Rich set of number classes:
   Integer (unlimited precision), rational, short float, single 
   float, double float, long float (unlimited precision), complex,
   modular integer, univariate polynomial.
 * Elementary, logical, transcendental functions.
 * C++ as implementation language brings
       o efficiency,
       o type safety,
       o algebraic syntax.
 * Memory efficiency:
       o Small integers and short floats are immediate, not heap
         allocated.
       o Automatic, non-interruptive garbage collection.
 * Speed efficiency:
       o Assembly language kernel for some CPUs,
       o Karatsuba and Schoenhage-Strassen multiplication.
 * Interoperability:
       o Garbage collection with no burden on the main application,
       o hooks for memory allocation and exceptions.
