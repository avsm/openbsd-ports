This is completely experimental! This is here so that people can
play with it.

Things *will* break!  This is totally expected. Dependencies are still
incomplete.

There are issues in KDE proper (it's released, but it's still early
days yet for KDE4), and some issues related to OpenBSD.

Also, this KDE4 will leave you with quite a few processes lying around
when you've played with it.

It should be obvious, but the list of things to be done is too long to
maintain; just find something that doesn't work for you, fix it, and 
post a "cvs diff -u" to ports@.
