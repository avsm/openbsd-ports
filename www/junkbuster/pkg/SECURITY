These patches change numerous uses of the str(cmp, cat, cpy)
operations and changes them to their length limited strn counterparts.
All instances of sprintf have also been changed to snprintf.

Several cases where malloc is used without checking its return value
have also had some rudimentary error checking added.

Hopefully this results in a more stable and more secure version of
junkbuster - suitable to run as a service for more than just personal
use.

These patches have been submitted to the junkbuster dev team and
as soon as they incorporate them, we wont need to maintain our own
patched version.
