This module implements RFC 2545, RFC 2931 and
draft-ietf-dnsext-delegation-signer-09.txt.

The extensions provide the following additional features on top of
the Net::DNS module:

 - DS, SIG, KEY and NXT records. These are all implemented as RR
   objects. The cryptography has been implemented using Crypt::OpenSSL::DSA
   and Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA.

The reason for not making these RRs a part of the regular Net::DNS
module is that they rely on crypto modules which are not portable.

In addition to the RR classes, Net::DNS::Keyset provides an abstract
interface for working with keysets. Keysets are administrative files
used by the BIND tools for key maintenance tasks.

The DNSSEC protocol is a moving target. Follow the IETF DNSEXT
working group if you are interested in the protocol development.
We try to keep the code in sync with the development.
