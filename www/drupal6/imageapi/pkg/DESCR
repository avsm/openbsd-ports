A non writing image manipulation API for Drupal. This API is meant to be used in place of the API provided 
by image.inc. You probably do not need to install this module unless another module are you using requires
it. It provides no new features to your drupal site. It only provides an API other modules can leverage.

Changes From image.inc API:
  - Images are objects.
  - Images are not written on each image operation and must be explicitly 
    closed when processing is complete. 
  - Multiple Image ToolKits can be used simultaneously. However, only the image
    toolkit and image was opened with can be used to process it. This is hidden 
    in the imageapi layer.
