Running Hudson on OpenBSD.

To arrange for the standalone Hudson server to run automatically
on reboot, add the following to /etc/rc.local:

if [ -d ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/hudson ]; then
	sudo -u _hudson ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/hudson >/tmp/hudson.log 2>&1 &
fi

NOTE: This script runs Hudson on port 8000, not 8080, since most
Java application servers run on port 8080.

To run Hudson in an existing Java server, copy or link the war file
from ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/hudson to your server's deploy directory, or read
more at ${HOMEPAGE}.


The Hudson data files are in this directory (/var/hudson), under the
"hidden" directory ".hudson".
