phpLDAPAdmin has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

Edit ${INSTDIR}/config.php to configure phpLDAPAdmin.

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
	# cd /var/www/htdocs
	# ln -s ../phpldapadmin-${VERSION} phpldapadmin
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

For jpeg photos to work properly, you must do this:       
	# mkdir /var/www/tmp      
	# chown www:daemon /var/www/tmp
	# chmod 1755 /var/www/tmp
(where tmp is the $jpeg_temp_dir configured in config.php)

You can ensure you have a working install by accessing:
http://<localhost>/phpldapadmin/index.php
