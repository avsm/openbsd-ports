Moodle is a learning management system for producing Internet-based 
course Web sites. It has been designed to support modern pedagogies 
based on social constructionist theory, and includes activity modules 
such as forums, chats, resources, journals, quizzes, surveys, choices, 
workshops, glossaries, lessons, and assignments.
