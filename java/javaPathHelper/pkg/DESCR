javaPathHelper is a script that java applications can use to provide a
consistent and familiar method for launching java applications on
OpenBSD. The use of JAVACMD, JAVA_HOME and PATH environment variables are
well known methods for users to control which JVM is used to launch a
java application.  When a user sets up his environment javaPathHelper will
use it. No attempt is made to prevent the user from running an
application that requires a particular JVM version with a lower version.
When the user's environment has not be setup, javaPathHelper falls back
to inspecting which JDK or JVM satisfied the RUN_DEPENDS for the
package.
