OpenCDK (Open Crypto Development Kit) provides basic parts 
of the OpenPGP message format. The aim of the library is 
*not* to replace any available OpenPGP version. There will be 
no real support for key management (sign, revoke, alter 
preferences, etc) and some other parts are only rudimentary
available. The main purpose is to handle and understand 
OpenPGP packets and to use basic operations.
