# Note that "lesstif" is NOT a dependency: Kaffe has its own, Motifless, AWT.
# You must have the X11 client packages installed; no good way to DEPEND this
# (if you don't, I think it will build a command-line-only Java--untested).

			png.1.::graphics/png

# This port REQUIRES shared libs, and will not work without them
# (dynamic linking is an essential element of Java).
# At present it is only known to work on i386. 
# Builds nicely, but does not run at all, on sparc (gets 
# nullpointerexceptions everywhere).
