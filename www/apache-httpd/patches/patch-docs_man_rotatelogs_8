 \fIlogfile\fR
 The path plus basename of the logfile\&. If \fIlogfile\fR includes any '%' characters, it is treated as a format string for strftime(3)\&. Otherwise, the suffix \fI\&.nnnnnnnnnn\fR is automatically added and is the time in seconds\&. Both formats compute the start time from the beginning of the current period\&. For example, if a rotation time of 86400 is specified, the hour, minute, and second fields created from the strftime(3) format will all be zero, referring to the beginning of the current 24-hour period (midnight)\&.
