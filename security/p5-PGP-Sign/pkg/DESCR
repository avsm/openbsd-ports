This module sprung out of a need to do one thing and one thing only,
do it securely, and do it well.  This module creates and checks
detached signatures for data.  That's it.  If you want to do anything

Currently this module only works with text data.  Support for binary
data is high on the list of features I want to add.

By default, it works with the GNU Privacy Guard (security/gnupg),
and the following flavors are available for alternatives:
