smtpscan is a remote SMTP server version detector. It can be used to
guess which mail software is used on a remote server, that may hide its
SMTP banner.

smtpscan works by testing the remote SMTP server's reaction on different
tests defined in ${PREFIX}/share/smtpscan/tests. Almost all of these tests
consist of weird SMTP requests, whose answer is not precisely defined in
the corresponding RFCs. Some other times, they check whether the remote
SMTP server is simply RFC compliant. After each test, the remote server
returns an SMTP Error Message. Fingerprints are made of SMTP Error Messages
corresponding to the tests.
