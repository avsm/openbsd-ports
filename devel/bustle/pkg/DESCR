Bustle draws sequence diagrams of D-Bus activity, showing signal
emissions, method calls and their corresponding returns, with timestamps
for each individual event and the duration of each method call. This can
help you check for unwanted D-Bus traffic, and pinpoint why your
D-Bus-based application isn't performing as well as you like.

There are also command-line tools for generating statistics from D-Bus
traces.
