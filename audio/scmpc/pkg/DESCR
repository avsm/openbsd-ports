scmpc is a client for MPD which submits your tracks to Last.fm.

  - Can be run as a daemon, either as a user or as root.
  - Keeps unsubmitted songs in a queue which is saved to a file at a
    configurable interval.
  - Will try to reconnect to MPD and Audioscrobbler if the network
    connection fails.
  - Works with a password-protected MPD server.
  - Works when crossfading is enabled.
