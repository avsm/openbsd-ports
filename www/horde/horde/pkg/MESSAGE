The Horde application framework has been installed into ${PREFIX}/${INSTDIR}.
Symlink this into the DocumentRoot of your web-server, e.g.

   # ln -s ../horde /var/www/htdocs/horde

Ensure that the required PHP extensions are activated (with symlinks
in /var/www/conf/php5 pointing to the sample files in php5.sample,
as directed by the installation messages for the PHP extensions) and
that the web server has been restarted.

Then follow the steps in the Configuring Horde and Securing Horde
sections of ${PREFIX}/${INSTDIR}/docs/INSTALL and ensure that you have a
working installation by accessing http://<localhost>/horde/test.php.
Now you can configure Horde-based applications (IMP, etc) by following
their individual guide in ${PREFIX}/${INSTDIR}/<module>/docs/INSTALL.
