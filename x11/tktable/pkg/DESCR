 * supports standard Tk reliefs, fonts, colors, etc.
 * x/y scrollbar support
 * 'tag' styles per row, column or cell to change visual appearance

 * support for disabled (read-only) tables or cells (via tags)
 * multiple selection modes, with "active" cell
 * multiple drawing modes to get optimal performance for larger tables
