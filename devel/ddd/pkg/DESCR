What is DDD, anyway?
====================

    The Data Display Debugger (DDD) is a common graphical user
    interface to GDB, DBX, and XDB, the popular UNIX debuggers.
    Besides ``usual'' features such as viewing source texts and
    breakpoints, DDD provides a graphical data display, where data
    structures are displayed as graphs.  A simple mouse click
    dereferences pointers or reveals structure contents, updated each
    time the program stops.  Using DDD, you can reason about your
    application by viewing its data, not just by viewing it execute
    lines of source code.

    Other DDD features include: debugging of programs written in C,
    C++, Ada, Fortran, Pascal, Modula-2, or Modula-3; machine-level
    debugging; hypertext source navigation and lookup; breakpoint,
    backtrace, and history editors; preferences and settings editors;
    program execution in terminal emulator window; debugging on remote
    host; on-line manual; interactive help on the Motif user
    interface; GDB/DBX/XDB command-line interface with full editing,
    history, and completion capabilities.  DDD has been designed to
    compete with well-known commercial debuggers.
    
    DDD is free software, protected by the GNU general public license.
    It is actively maintained by its authors, Dorothea Luetkehaus and
    Andreas Zeller at the Technische Universitaet Braunschweig,
    Germany.
