Panels allows the creation of complex layouts for nodes 
by experienced users. In its easiest form, one can create
a composite node of 'panels' content type referencing several
other nodes and views, and have it display in two/three columns.

This contrasts with the default site blocks construction, which
affects the whole site and is not suited for a complex frontpage,
since it bleeds into every page.
