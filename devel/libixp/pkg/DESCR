libixp is a stand-alone client/server 9P library including ixpc client. It
consists of less than 2000 lines of code (including ixpc).

9P is a network protocol developed at Bell Labs for the Plan 9 from Bell Labs
distributed operating system as the means of accessing and manipulating
resources and applications transparently in a distributed environment. 9P works
both as a distributed file system and as a network transparent and language
agnostic 'API'.

libixp's server API is based heavily on that of Plan 9's lib9p, and the two
libraries export virtually identical data structures.
