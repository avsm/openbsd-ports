The Digest::MD4 module allows you to use the RSA Data Security Inc. MD4
Message Digest algorithm from within Perl programs. The algorithm takes
as input a message of arbitrary length and produces as output a 128-bit
"fingerprint" or "message digest" of the input.

The Digest::MD4 module provide a procedural interface for simple use, as
well as an object oriented interface that can handle messages of
arbitrary length and which can read files directly.
