Exmh is an X user interface for MH mail. MH provides a set of UNIX
commands that manage folders and mail messages. MH has a zillion
features as a result of several years of availability. Exmh provides a
graphical interface to many of these features, but not everything. You
can do all the ordinary things like viewing the messages in a folder,
and reading, deleting, and refiling messages. In addition, the
interface handles arbitrary nesting of your folder hierarchy.

Exmh has a number of optional features that require additional
software to be installed. You may want to consider some or all of
these packages:
    antiword
    glimpse
    openldap
    par
    procmail

In addition, exmh supports various implementations of pgp. There are
packages available for:
    gnupg
    pgp5
