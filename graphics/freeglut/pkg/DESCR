freeglut is a completely OpenSourced alternative to the OpenGL Utility
Toolkit (GLUT) library written by Mark Kilgard.

GLUT (and hence freeglut) allows the user to create and manage windows
containing OpenGL contexts on a wide range of platforms and also read
the mouse, keyboard and joystick functions.
