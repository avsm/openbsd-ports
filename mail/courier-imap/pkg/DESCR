This server provides IMAP access to Maildir format mailboxes.  It
does not handle traditional mailbox files.

It is part of the Courier mail server (http://www.courier-mta.org)
but can be configured as a standalone IMAP server.

Features include an extremely small memory footprint, abstract
authentication modules (e.g. /etc/passwd, LDAP, PAM), virtual mailbox
support, resource controls, SSL/TLS, shared folders, and IPv6 support.
