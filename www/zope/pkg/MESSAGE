+---------------
| This package uses the INSTANCE_HOME installation method, as described
| at http://www.zope.org/Members/4am/instancehome.  This allows you
| to install the Zope package once and create as many sites as you
| want without changing your core Zope installation.
|
| Have a look at ${ZOPEHOME}/doc/README.OpenBSD
| to see how to create your instance and have it start at boot time.
