SQLite is a C library that implements an embeddable SQL database engine.
Programs that link with the SQLite library can have SQL database access
without running a separate RDBMS process. The distribution comes with a
standalone command-line access program (sqlite3) that can be used to
administer an SQLite database and which serves as an example of how to
use the SQLite library.
