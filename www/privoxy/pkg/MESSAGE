Note for people upgrading from 3.0.16 and before: There is now an rc
script that will start privoxy chrooted to /var/privoxy. Any
configuration files will be copied over automatically, but you need to
make sure that any other directories which are needed by privoxy (e.g.
the log directories) exist relative to the chroot and have proper
privileges for the _privoxy user.
