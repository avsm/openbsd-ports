SpeedyCGI is a way to run perl scripts persistently, which can make them
run much more quickly.

After the script is initially run, instead of exiting, the perl
interpreter is kept running. During subsequent runs, this interpreter is
used to handle new executions instead of starting a new perl interpreter
each time. A very fast frontend program, written in C, is executed for
each request. This fast frontend then contacts the persistent Perl
process, which is usually already running, to do the work and return the
results.
