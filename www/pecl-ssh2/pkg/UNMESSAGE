You can disable this module by removing the
${PREFIX}/conf/php5/ssh2.ini symbolic link by
issuing the following command: 

rm -f ${PREFIX}/conf/php5/ssh2.ini

If you already have Apache running on your machine,
you should not use "apachectl restart" - instead,
you should fully stop and then restart the server.
