py-suds is a python soap web services client library. Suds leverages
python meta programming to provide an intuative API for consuming web
services. Objectification of types defined in the WSDL is provided
without class generation.  Programmers rarely need to read the WSDL
since services and WSDL based objects can be easily inspected.
It supports pluggable soap bindings.
