GNU Stow is a Perl program for managing the installation of
software packages, keeping them separated from each other while
making them appear to be installed in the same place by using
symbolic links.

Stow is particularly useful when installing software distributed
with a GNU "configure" script (use the --prefix=path option).

Stow may be used by non-root users to set up a private hierarchy
under e.g. $HOME/local, or by local administrators who wants
to install software that is not managed by the native package
or port system, and make it available under e.g. /opt/local or
/usr/pkg.
