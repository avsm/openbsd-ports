This is the official httpd distributed by the Apache Server Project,
provided as a port for those who, for various reasons, need to run
version 2. 

OpenBSD provides a custom Apache server, httpd(8), in the base system
which has been audited for security and may run in a chroot(2)
environment.  Users are STRONGLY encouraged to use the system httpd
rather than this port.
