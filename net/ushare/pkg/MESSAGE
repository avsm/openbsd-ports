USHARE_IFACE (listening interface) and USHARE_DIR (shared directories)
need to be set in ${SYSCONFDIR}/ushare.conf before starting ushare.

UPnP multicast discovery on the listening interface needs to be enabled.
Add this line to the matching hostname.if(5) and restart the network
(a.b.c.d being the interface IP address).
!route -qn add -net 239.0.0.0/8 -interface a.b.c.d
