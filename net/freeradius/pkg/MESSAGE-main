Review the sample configuration files in ${SYSCONFDIR}/raddb (starting
with radiusd.conf) and adapt as necessary. For the first run, start
radiusd manually with the -X flag.

To have freeradius start at system boot, you may insert the following
into /etc/rc.local:

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/radiusd ]; then
	install -d -o _freeradius /var/run/radiusd
	echo -n ' radiusd';	${PREFIX}/sbin/radiusd
fi

This will start radiusd and use ${SYSCONFDIR}/raddb/radiusd.conf for the
configuration. Example configuration files can be found in
${PREFIX}/share/examples/freeradius.
