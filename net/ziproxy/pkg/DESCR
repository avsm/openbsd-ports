Ziproxy is forwarding, non-caching, compressing HTTP proxy server.
Basically it squeezes images by converting them to lower quality JPEGs
or JPEG 2000 and compresses (gzip) HTML and other text-like data.  It
also provides other features such as: HTML/JS/CSS optimization,
preemptive hostname resolution, transparent proxying and more.
