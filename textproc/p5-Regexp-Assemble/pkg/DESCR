Regexp::Assemble takes an arbitrary number of regular expressions and
assembles them into a single regular expression (or RE) that matches all
that the individual REs match.

As a result, instead of having a large list of expressions to loop over,
a target string only needs to be tested against one expression.  This is
interesting when you have several thousand patterns to deal with.
Serious effort is made to produce the smallest pattern possible.
