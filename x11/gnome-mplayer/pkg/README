Running gnome-mplayer on OpenBSD
================================

To prevent errors, the "unclutter" program (from x11/unclutter) must not
be running when using gnome-mplayer.

MPlayer software volume control (softvol) is enabled by default because
there is no volume control in mplayer's sndio(7) backend.

To use the gnome-power-manager's inhibit method instead of the
XScrnSaver one, go into Edit->Preferences->Interface and remove the
checkmark from "Use X Screen Saver control over Gnome Power Manager"
(this obviously needs the gnome-power-manager package to be installed).
