This is nethack.  Will you dare explore the dungeon, kill creepy monsters,
and finish the game ?   At least, you're starting with a bonus: a puppy
(or a kitten) to help you.

If you find that game too easy, you may want to try slash instead.

- in order to use nethack with X11 graphics, you need the nethack-*-x11 
FLAVOR. You will also have to add ${PREFIX}/lib/X11/fonts/hack to your 
fontpath, see xset(1) and Xserver(1), also /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm or 
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xinit for proper configuration.

- the tty with colors mode uses ANSI colors, unless it finds a suitable
termcap entry, for instance xterm-color.

P.S. This is a very addictive game, with its whole wacky culture. And even
   a newsgroup dedicated to it (rec.games.roguelike.nethack). Don't say we
   didn't warn you !
