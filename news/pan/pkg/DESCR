Pan is a newsreader, loosely based on Agent and Gravity, which attempts
to be pleasant to use for new and advanced users alike. It has all the
typical features found in newsreaders and also supports offline newsreading,
sophisticated filtering, multiple connections, and a number of extra features
for power users and alt.binaries fans.  It's also the only Unix newsreader
to get a perfect score on the Good Net-Keeping Seal of Approval evalutions.
