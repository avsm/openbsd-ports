This module adds PHP-based password strength checking and validation
routines that mirror the jQuery routines, so that administrators can
restrict passwords to only be, for example, "high" strength. The module
simply modifies existing password confirm fields (where two passwords
are entered, like the user edit form), so no other setup is required
beyond configuring the desired enforcement rules.
