ImageCache is a dynamic image manipulation and cache tool. It allows you to
create a namespace that corresponds to a set of image manipulation actions. It
generates a derivative image the first time it is requested from a namespace
until the namespace or the entire imagecache is flushed.

ImageCache presets can be put to use in various other modules. For example, when
using CCK with the Imagefield module, you can use the "Display fields" local
task tab to choose a preset to apply to images in that field. Similarly, you
can specify a preset when displaying images attached to nodes using Imagefield
in a View through the Views UI.
