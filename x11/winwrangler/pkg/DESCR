WinWrangler is a simple project whose aim is to add additional
functionality to all standards compliant window managers. This means
that it should work under Gnome, KDE and XFCE.
WinWrangler provides a desktop daemon that can be controlled via
desktop-wide hotkeys to do advanced window manipulations that are not
normally provided by the window manager. For example tiling and
intelligent expansion of windows.
If the default shortcuts don't suit you, tweak
~/.config/hotkeys/winwrangler.hotkeys
