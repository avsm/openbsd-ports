This module implements Ueli Maurer's algorithm for generating large
provable primes and secure parameters for public-key cryptosystems.  The
generated primes are almost uniformly distributed over the set of primes of
the specified bitsize and expected time for generation is less than the time
required for generating a pseudo-prime of the same size with Miller-Rabin
tests.

Crypt::Primes is a pure perl implementation.  It uses Math::Pari for
multiple precision integer arithmetic and number theoretic functions.
Random numbers are gathered with Crypt::Random, a perl interface to
/dev/arandom device found on most modern Unix operating systems.
