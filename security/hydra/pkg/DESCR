There are already several login hacker tools available, however none does
either support more than one protocol to attack or support parallized
connects.

Currently this tool supports TELNET, FTP, POP3, IMAP, HTTP Basic and Cisco
authentication only, however the module engine for new services is very easy
so it won't take a long time until more services are supported.
Planned are: SSH, SAMBA, PCNFS, R-services, and more.
Additionally, password only protocols will be supported in the future:
SNMP, RIP, OSPF and others.
