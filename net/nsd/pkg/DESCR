The NLnet Labs Name Server Daemon (NSD) is an authoritative RFC compliant 
DNS nameserver.  It was first conceived to allow for more genetic 
diversity for DNS server implementations used by the root-server system 
and it has been developed for operations in environments where speed, 
reliability, stability, and security are of high importance.
