Fvwm is a window manager for X, which provides a virtual/multiple
disjoint desktop, a 3D look for windows decorations, shaped/color
icons. It gives a very good emulation of mwm. A nice button-bar
can be used to provide convenient access to frequently used
functions or programs.

Comes with a set of icons.

Flavors:
	rplay	- build with audio/rplay and provide sound support
	debug	- turn on debugging messages
