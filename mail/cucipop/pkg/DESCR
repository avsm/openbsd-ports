A fast and robust implementation of the RFC1939 POP3 protocol.
It supports both BSD-type and SysV-type mailbox formats. Cucipop
assumes that the mailbox it serves is not simultaneously accessed
by a mailreader. Concurrency and locking issues are handled
graciously if they restrict themselves to the mail delivery agent.
