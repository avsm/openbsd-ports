bzr-svn is a plugin that allows Bazaar direct access to Subversion
repositories. It allows most bzr commands to work directly against
Subversion repositories, as if you were using bzr with a native bzr
repository.

The plugin can at the moment be used to commit to, pull from, merge
from, push to and view logs of Subversion branches from Bazaar.
