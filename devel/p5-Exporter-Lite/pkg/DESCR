This is an alternative to Exporter intended to provide a lightweight
subset of its functionality. It supports import(), @EXPORT and
@EXPORT_OK and not a whole lot else.

Unlike Exporter, it is not necessary to inherit from Exporter::Lite
(ie. no @ISA = qw(Exporter::Lite) mantra). Exporter::Lite simply
exports its import() function. This might be called a "mix-in".
