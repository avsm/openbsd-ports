The Glasgow Haskell Compiler is a robust, fully-featured, optimising
compiler for the functional programming language Haskell 98.

GHC compiles Haskell to either native code or C. It implements
numerous experimental language extensions to Haskell, including
concurrency, a foreign language interface, several type-system
extensions, exceptions, and so on. GHC comes with a generational
garbage collector, a space and time profiler, and a comprehensive
set of libraries.
