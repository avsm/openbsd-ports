  use File::Finder;
  ## simulate "-type f"
  my $all_files = File::Finder->type('f');

  ## any rule can be extended:
  my $all_files_printer = $all_files->print;

File::Find is great, but constructing the wanted routine can
sometimes be a pain.  This module provides a wanted-writer, using
syntax that is directly mappable to the find command's syntax.
