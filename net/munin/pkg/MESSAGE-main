Install p5-Net-SNMP to use the optional SNMP-based monitors.

To have munin-node start at boot time, you have to create symlinks
in ${SYSCONFDIR}/munin/plugins as described in the manual (manually
or with munin-node-configure), adapt ${SYSCONFDIR}/munin/munin-node.conf
as necessary, and insert the following into /etc/rc.local.

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/munin-node ]; then
        install -d -o _munin /var/run/munin
        echo -n ' munin-node';   ${PREFIX}/sbin/munin-node
fi
