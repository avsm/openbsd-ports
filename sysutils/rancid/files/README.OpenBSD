On OpenBSD, RANCID lives and works in /var/rancid, with user id _rancid.

Quick Installation Guide (an example):

1) Modify ${SYSCONFDIR}/rancid.conf.  The variable LIST_OF_GROUPS is a space 
   delimited list of router "groups".
   e.g.:
	LIST_OF_GROUPS="backbone aggregation switches"

2) Create /var/rancid/.cloginrc, with read/write permissions only for
   the _rancid user, e.g. 0600 or 0640.

   Review ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/examples/rancid/cloginrc.sample for examples 
   and a good starting point.  See also cloginrc(5).

   Test to make sure that you can login to every router.

3) Set up mail aliases, by modifing /etc/mail/aliases.  Rancid
   sends the diffs and other administrative emails to rancid-<GROUP> and
   problems to rancid-admin-<GROUP>, where <GROUP> is the "GROUP" of
   routers.  This way you can separate your backbone routers from your
   access routers or separate based upon network.

4) Initialize RANCID CVS repository with `rancid-cvs' as the _rancid
   user.  This creates all of the necessary directories and config files
   for each of the groups in LIST_OF_GROUPS and imports them into CVS.
   This will also need to be run each time a new group is added.  Do not
   create the directories or CVS repository manually, allow rancid-cvs
   do it.  See also rancid-cvs(1).

5) For each "group", modify the router.db file in the group directory.
   The file is of the form "router:mfg:state", where "router" is
   the name (we use FQDN) of the router, mfg is the manufacturer from
   the set of (cat5|cisco|juniper), and "state" is either up or down.
   Each router listed as "up" will have the configuration grabbed.
   Note: manufacturer cat5 is intended only for cisco catalyst switches
   running catalyst (not IOS) code.  See also router.db(5).

6) For first-time users or new installations, run `rancid-run' (with no
   arguments) as the user _rancid and check the resulting log file(s)
   (in /var/rancid/logs/*) for errors.  Repeat until there are no
   errors.

7) Put `rancid-run' in _rancid's crontab to be called however often you
   want it to run for each group (rancid-run [<GROUP>]).  If you run it
   less often than once/hour, check the setting of OLDTIME in
   ${SYSCONFDIR}/rancid.conf.

   Example:
	# run config differ hourly
	1 * * * * ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/rancid-run
	# clean out config differ logs
	50 23 * * * /usr/bin/find /var/rancid/logs -type f -mtime +2 -exec rm {} \;
