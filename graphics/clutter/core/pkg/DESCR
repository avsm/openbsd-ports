Clutter is an open source software library for creating fast, visually
rich and animated graphical user interfaces.

Clutter uses OpenGL (and optionally OpenGL ES for use on Mobile and
embedded platforms) for rendering but with an API which hides the
underlying GL complexity from the developer. The Clutter API is intended
to be easy to use, efficient and flexible.
