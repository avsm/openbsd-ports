GNU Classpath, Essential Libraries for Java, is a GNU project to create
free core class libraries for use with virtual machines and compilers
for the java programming language.

Classpath is still a work in progress.  The first public release will be
version 1.0.  There have been no public releases; however, pre-release
source code is available via GNU's anonymous CVS server, and snapshots
of the Classpath tree have been released and are available from
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/classpath/
