This package only installs XEmacs engine with very _basic_ functions.

You now have to install XEmacs packages to enable all its features.
XEmacs packages are commonly put in the /usr/local/lib/xemacs/
directory.

To create it, do the following (as root) :
install -d -g wsrc -m 775 -o root /usr/local/lib/xemacs

There are two ways to install packages :

1. You can  fetch a "sumo" tarball  containing  all supported packages
   for XEmacs      (prefered   way),   those    files    are     named
   'xemacs-sumo.tar.gz' and 'xemacs-mule-sumo.tar.gz' and are found in
   the packages/ directory of almost any XEmacs mirror.
   (like ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/packages/)

   Once   you   have    those  files    you    unpack    them in   the
   /usr/local/lib/xemacs  directory (you must be in  the group wsrc to
   do this). This creates  a xemacs-packages and, if  you use mule,  a
   mule-packages subdirectory in "/usr/local/lib/xemacs".

2. You can also use the   user-friendly package installation  frontend
   integrated into xemacs.  To do this,  run XEmacs being a  user with
   enough credentials to write into /usr/local/lib/xemacs and type :
	  M-x list-packages <RET> 

   You can then select packages with the 'return' key and install them
   with 'x'. Note that you must have access to ftp sites on the net to
   do this.

More info about packages can be found in XEmacs info tree :
type "info xemacs" to browse it.
