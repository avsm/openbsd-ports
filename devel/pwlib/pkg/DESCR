PWLib is a moderately large class library that has its genesis many
years ago as a method to product applications to run on both Microsoft
Windows and Unix X-Window systems.
Since then the system has grown to include many classes that assist in
writing complete multi-platform applications. Classes for I/O
portability, multi-threading portability, aid in producing unix daemons
and NT services portably and all sorts of internet protocols were added
over the years. The library now also supports the open H323 project.
