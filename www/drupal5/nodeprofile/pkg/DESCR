This module builds user profiles as nodes, which opens the opportunity
to use the Content Construction Kit (CCK). So it's possible to make
use of the field types, which are available for CCK. The integration
of the views module allows one to easily build customizable user
listings or even user searches.

Furthermore it allows one

    * to build nodeprofiles consisting of several content types,
    * to build different nodeprofiles for different roles or
    * to build multiple (different kind of) nodeprofiles for the same users.
