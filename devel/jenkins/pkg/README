Running Jenkins on OpenBSD.

To arrange for the standalone Jenkins server to run automatically
on reboot, add "jenkins" to "rc_scripts" in /etc/rc.conf.local, e.g.:

rc_scripts="${rc_scripts} jenkins"

NOTE: This script runs Jenkins on port 8000, not 8080, since most
Java application servers run on port 8080.

To run Jenkins in another Java web/application server, copy the war
file from ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/jenkins to your server's deploy
directory, or read more at ${HOMEPAGE}. 

To use the email notifications, you will have to configure a valid
sending address (and SMTP server, if not localhost) under
Manage Jenkins -> Email Configuration.

The Jenkins data files are in the home directory (/var/jenkins),
under the "hidden" directory ".jenkins".
