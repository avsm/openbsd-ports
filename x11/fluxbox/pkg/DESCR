Fluxbox is yet another windowmanager for X.
It's based on the Blackbox 0.61.1 code. Fluxbox looks like blackbox and
handles styles, colors, window placement and similar thing exactly like
blackbox (100% theme/style compability).

So what's the difference between fluxbox and blackbox then?
The answer is: LOTS!

Here is a list of features that fluxbox already has, or is in the works...
	* Configurable window tabs.
	* Iconbar (for minimized/iconified windows)
	* Wheel scroll changes workspace
	* Configurable titlebar (placement of buttons, new buttons etc) | 
	* KDE support
	* GNOME support
	* New native integrated keygrabber (supports emacs like keychains)
	* Maximize over slit option
	* Other minor features
