USHARE_IFACE (listening interface) and USHARE_DIR (shared directories)
need to be set in ${SYSCONFDIR}/ushare.conf before starting ushare.

To start ushare at boot time, add the following to /etc/rc.local:
if [ -x ${PREFIX}/bin/ushare ]; then
	echo -n ' ushare'; ${PREFIX}/bin/ushare -D
fi

UPnP multicast discovery on the listening interface needs to be enabled.
Add this line to the matching hostname.if(5) and restart the network
(a.b.c.d being the interface IP address).
!route -qn add -net 239.0.0.0/8 -interface a.b.c.d
