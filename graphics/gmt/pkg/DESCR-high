GMT is an open source collection of ~60 tools for manipulating
geographic and Cartesian data sets (including filtering, trend fitting,
gridding, projecting, etc.) and producing PostScript illustrations
ranging from simple x-y plots via contour maps to artificially
illuminated surfaces and 3-D perspective views. GMT supports ~30 map
projections and transformations and comes with support data such as
coastlines, rivers, and political boundaries.

This package adds high resolution coastline data to GMT.
