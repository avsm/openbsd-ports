Echinus supports managing window in floating, tiled and maximized
layouts. All the configuration is made via config file in Xresources
format. Echinus supports a small subset of EWMH to be compatible with
external panels and pagers. The goal of development is a small, fast
window manager without features not strictly related to window
management.
