The Free Software Foundation's text processing utilities, for rearranging,
reformatting and generally mangling text.
 
Many of the utilities exist in the OpenBSD base collection, but the GNU
versions have added functionality, which is sometimes useful.

All the binaries are prefixed by the letter g to differentiate them
with the standard applications with the same name.

Note that this port will install these utilities with a 'g' prefix,
e.g. gtar, but the texinfo documentation will refer to them without
the 'g' prefix.
