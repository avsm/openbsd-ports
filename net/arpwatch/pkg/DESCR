Arpwatch monitors ethernet activity and maintains a database of
ethernet/ip address pairings. It also reports certain changes via
email.

Arpsnmp has the same database features of arpwatch but relies on
an external agent to collect the arp data.

Please send bugs and comments to arpwatch@ee.lbl.gov.
