polkitd(8) runs setuid(2) root in order to allow applications
to request additional fine-grained privileges (e.g. adjust the clock,
change timezone...). Access to these privileges is controlled by policy
files and user passwords.

If you'd like to completely disable priviledge granting through the
PolicyKit framework, create the file:
    ${SYSCONFDIR}/polkit-1/nullbackend.conf.d/99-nullbackend.conf
containing the following lines:
[Configuration]
Priority=99
