Cnagios is a full-screen terminal interface for viewing Nagios
HOST and SERVICE objects, and the durations of their current states.

It's lightning fast because it's written in C using the curses
library. And it's super flexible because it uses hooks directly
into the perl C library to shorten plugin output and filter the
displayed HOSTs or SERVICEs.
