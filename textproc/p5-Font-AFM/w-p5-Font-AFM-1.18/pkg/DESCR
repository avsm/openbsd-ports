This module implements the Font::AFM class. Objects of this class
are initialised from an AFM-file and allows you to obtain information
about the font and the metrics of the various glyphs in the font.

All measurements in AFM files are given in terms of units equal to
1/1000 of the scale factor of the font being used. To compute actual
sizes in a document, these amounts should be multiplied by (scale
factor of font)/1000.
