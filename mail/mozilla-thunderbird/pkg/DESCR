Mozilla Thunderbird is a redesign of the integrated Mozilla App-Suite
mail component. Its goal is to leverage much of the existing
functionality of that product to produce a stand-alone mail application
that is simple and extensible.

Thunerbird looks for plugins in ~/.mozilla/plugins
${LOCALBASE}/mozilla-thunderbird/plugins
and ${LOCALBASE}/lib/mozilla-plugins.

To make it look good you probably want some nice anti-aliased fonts,
like ${PORTSDIR}/x11/bitstream-vera-fonts.
To disable xft altogether set GDK_USE_XFT=0 in the environment.
