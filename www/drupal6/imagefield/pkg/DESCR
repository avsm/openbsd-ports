ImageField provides an "Image" widget type to CCK. This module leverages the
functionality of FileField and behaves nearly identically. ImageField widgets
will give you a nice thumbnail preview of the image when uploaded, and provides
a few display options (formatters) within CCK to display the images when the
content is viewed.
