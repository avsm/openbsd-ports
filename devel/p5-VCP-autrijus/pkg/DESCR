vcp (and the Perl module VCP.pm) is a system for copying resources under
version control between repositories. CVS, p4 and VSS repositories are
currently supported.

vcp can filter, rearrange repositories, and alter metadata during a
transfer.  These capabilities are used to handle conversion details like
different branching models and legal character sets between various
repositories.
