================
KAFFE OpenVM 1.0
================

This is "Kaffe OpenVM", a complete virtual machine and class library
set which allows the execution of Java code without any code from
Javasoft.  It comes with a virtual machine and a set of class
libraries including beans, and the all important AWT graphics system.
This is the first full JDK1.1 release of the runtime, and also
includes a compiler (javac-compatible).

This code was changed from the BSD license to the GPL with 1.0B1.
The 0.8 BSD licensed version can possibly be obtained by checking out
with a date code of 1998, but you may have trouble finding the
distfiles, which we no longer fetch or track.
