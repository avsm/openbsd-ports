SWATCH - The Simple WATCHer and filter

       Swatch is designed to  monitor  system  activity.   Swatch
       requires a configuration file which contains pattern(s) to
       look for and action(s) to do when each pattern is found.

      The file contains four TAB separated fields:

/pattern/[,/pattern/,...] action[,action,...] [[HH:]MM:]SS start:length

       A pattern must be a regular expression which perl(1)  will
       accept,  which  is very similar to the regular expressions
       which egrep(1) accepts.

       The following actions are acceptable:

       echo[=mode]
       bell[=N]
       exec=command
       ignore
       mail[=address:address:...]
       pipe=command
       write[=user:user:...]
