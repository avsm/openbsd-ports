Grip is a cd-player and cd-ripper for the GNOME desktop. It has the
ripping capabilities of cdparanoia builtin, but can also use external
rippers (such as cdda2wav). It also provides an automated frontend for
MP3 (and other audio format) encoders, letting you take a disc and
transform it easily straight into MP3s. Internet disc lookups are
supported for retrieving track information from disc database servers.

To encode MP3s an external encoder (like audio/lame or audio/bladeenc)
is needed.
