 The 'Buffering' tab works just like the 'OSS Driver' one.

+
+3.6.2.4 BSD Sun Output
+----------------------
+The 'Sun' output plugin will use the native audio(4) interface provided
+by OpenBSD and NetBSD for playback and mixing.
+
+The $AUDIODEVICE and $MIXERDEVICE environment variables will override the
+current configuration settings. Defaults are /dev/audio and /dev/mixer.
+
+In the 'Devices' tab you can change the audio, audioctl and mixer devices
+XMMS is going to use. The audioctl device is used for ioctl(2) calls
+independent of audio data I/O.
+
+In the 'Buffering' tab you can change how much data the Sun plugin will
+buffer. The 'Buffer size' ranges from 200 - 10000ms. If you want the plugin
+to wait for the buffer to be filled before it starts playing the music,
+change the 'Pre-buffer' value, this ranges from 0% - 90% of the 'Buffer size'
+value.
+
+In the 'Mixer' tab you can select the volume device to be affected when you
+alter the volume from XMMS. `XMMS uses mixer exclusively' causes XMMS to
+keep the mixer device open instead of re-opening it for each operation.
+
+There may also be some more options depending on what your audio mixer
+device supports (eg. loudness, spatial, surround, preamp).
+
+In the 'Status' tab you can see audio device information and real-time
+playback status.
