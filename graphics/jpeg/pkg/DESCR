This package contains software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding,
and transcoding.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression
method for full-color and gray-scale images.

This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive
compression processes.

A set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files is provided,
plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to
perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.
Also included is "jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between
different JPEG processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple
applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.
