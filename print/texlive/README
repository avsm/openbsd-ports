--- KNOWN ISSUES ---

 * gmverb is broken -- reported upstream, being ignored by package author.

 * man pages make noise
   At package time:
     /usr/ports/pobj/texlive_base-2010/fake-i386//usr/local/man/man1/texmfstart.1 :5: can't find macro file `www.tmac'

   At install/uninstall:
     Can't parse /usr/local/man/cat1/mendex.0 (not a manpage ?)

 * /usr/local/share/texmf* are left behind from previous texlive which cause
   a conflict with new texlive2010.

--- EXTRA? ---

 * Split down -docs even further this year: docs_srcs + docs_built (?)
   Probably not.

 * Pre-generate maps and formats and install from FILESDIR
   -> check this is platform independent.	done - works
