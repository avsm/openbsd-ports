Jakarta Tomcat on OpenBSD uses `%%SYSCONFDIR%%/tomcat' for its configuration files.

With the following command tomcat is started as user `_tomcat':
$ sudo -u _tomcat %%PREFIX%%/%%PKGNAME%%/bin/startup.sh

As `sudo' doesn't pass environment variables, you should define
environment variables in `%%SYSCONFDIR%%/tomcat/tomcat.rc'.

If you want Jakarta Tomcat to serve on privileged ports (e.g. 80),
then either edit `%%SYSCONFDIR%%/tomcat/server.xml' and change the Connector port
to 80, or even more secure: redirect all tcp traffic to port 80
to tomcat's default listener port 8080 using a pf.conf(5) rule like:

   rdr on $NIC proto tcp from any to any port 80 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080

`$CATALINA_BASE' (formerly `$TOMCAT_HOME') is `/var/tomcat'.
