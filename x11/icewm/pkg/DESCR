IceWM is a window manager for the X11 Window System. It has been
coded from scratch in C++ for performance and size and attempts to
achieve the following goals:

      Feel good and fast to use, be simple and don't get in the way 
      Default configuration should be fully usable without tweaking 
      Mouse is optional 
      Combine the best features of other window managers and GUIs 

IceWM allows reasonably configurable look using themes and is fully
GNOME and partially KDE compliant, but can also be used as a full
featured standalone environment.
