Netperf is a benchmark that can be used to measure various aspects of
networking performance.  Currently, its focus is on bulk data transfer
and request/response performance using either TCP or UDP, and the
Berkeley Sockets interface. In addition, tests for DLPI, the Fore ATM API,
Unix Domain Sockets, and HP HiPPI LLA may be conditionally compiled-in.
