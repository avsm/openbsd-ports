xce4-xkb displays the current keyboard layout and refreshes when the
layout changes.  Also the layout can be switched by simply clicking on
the plugin.  This plugin is used along with the XKB extension.  For now
the keyboard layouts cannot be configured from the plugin itself, they
should be set in the xorg.conf file or some other way (e.g. setxkbmap).
