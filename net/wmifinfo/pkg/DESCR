wmifinfo is a simple applet showing basic network info for all
available interfaces. It shows IP address, netmask, gateway and MAC
address. A bit like ifconfig.

Left-button click moves to the next interface, right-button click
calls up/down scripts. These can be set with the -u and -d options.
The '%s' variable is replaced with the interface name.
