Namazu is a full-text indexer/search engine intended for easy use.
Not only does it work as a small or medium scale Web search engine,
but also as a personal search system for email or other files.

It provides a CGI interface for web searches, and a command-line
search tool. Third-party frontends are available such as namazu.el
and Wanderlust on Emacs and Tknamazu on X Window System.

Filters enable namazu to index various formats of files. Some are
standalone (e.g. Mail/News); others require external dependencies.
