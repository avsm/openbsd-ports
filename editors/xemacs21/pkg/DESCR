About XEmacs:

XEmacs (formerly known as Lucid Emacs) is a powerful, extensible text
editor with full GUI support, initially based on an early version of
GNU Emacs 19 from the Free Software Foundation and since kept up to
date with recent versions of that product.

XEmacs provides a great number of new features.  More details on
XEmacs's functionality, including bundled packages, can be obtained
through the info on-line information system.
