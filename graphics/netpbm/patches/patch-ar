+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP
+.B -size width height
+Specifies the size of the convolution matrix.  
+Default size is a 3x3 matrix.
+Width and height sizes must be odd.  
+Maximum size of convolution matrix is limited by the maximum value for a 
+pixel such that (width * height * 2) must not exceed the maximum pixel value.
+.TP
+.B -dump dumpfile
+Generates and saves the convolution file only.
+Use of this option does not invoke pnmconvol.
