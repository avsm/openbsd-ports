Exim is a mail transfer agent (MTA) developed at the University of
Cambridge for use on Unix systems connected to the Internet. It is
freely available under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence.
In overall style it is similar to Smail 3, but its facilities are
more extensive. It contains facilities for verifying incoming sender
and recipient addresses, for refusing mail from specified hosts,
networks, or senders, and for controlling mail relaying. This version
also supports the STARTTLS extension.

This port can be built with the following flavors:

* no_x11	- do not build eximon which requires X11
* no_perl	- do not include perl support
* no_ssl	- do not include SSL/TLS support
* mysql		- support mysql queries for lookups
* postgresql	- support postgresql queries for lookups
* ldap		- support ldap (OpenLDAP) queries for lookups

All these flavors are independent of each other.
