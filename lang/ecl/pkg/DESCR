Embeddable common-lisp, that tries to conform to the ANSI standard.

Contrary to other common lisp implementations, it does not rely on
mmap at fixed addresses, and thus actually works.

The most relevant features:
 * A bytecodes compiler and interpreter.
 * Compiles Lisp also with any C/C++ compiler.
 * It can build standalone executables and libraries.
 * ASDF, Sockets, Gray streams, MOP, and other useful components.
 * Extremely portable.
