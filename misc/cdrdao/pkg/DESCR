What does it?

 Cdrdao records audio or data CD-Rs in disk-at-once (DAO) mode based
 on a textual description of the CD contents (toc-file).
 
Why DAO?

 Recording in disk-at-once mode writes the complete disc,
 i.e. lead-in, one or more tracks and lead-out, in a single step.
 The commonly used track-at-once (TAO) mode writes each track
 independently which requires link blocks between two tracks. Older
 CD-recorder models forced a two second pause (pre-gap) between two
 tracks whereas newer models allow adjusting of the pause length in
 TAO mode reducing the number of link blocks to a minimal amount.
 However, with TAO it is generally not possible to define the data
 that is written in pre-gaps. But exactly this feature makes audio
 CD recording interesting, e.g. by creating hidden bonus tracks or
 track intros in pre-gaps like it is common habit on commercial CDs.
 Finally, DAO recording is the only way to write data to the unused
 R-W sub-channels for e.g.  CD-G or CD-TEXT.
 
Features

 * Full control over length and contents of pre-gaps (pause areas
   between tracks). Pre-gaps may be completely omitted, e.g. for
   dividing live recordings into tracks.
 * Control over sub-channel data like:
      + catalog number
      + copy, pre-emphasis, 2-/4-channel flags
      + ISRC code
      + index marks
 * Support for exact audio or data CD copying.
 * Tracks may be composed of different audio files supporting non
   destructive cut.
 * Accepts WAVE and raw audio files.
 * CD-TEXT reading and writing with drives that support it.
