QuadKonsole is a terminal application that embeds Konsole kparts 
in a grid layout. This saves memory, provides faster startup, and 
makes it unnecessary to align your Konsole windows by hand. 
It also provides a lot more screen real estate, makes navigation 
easier by using arrow keys, and allows all Konsoles to minimized 
or maximized at once. It only occupies one slot in the taskbar.
