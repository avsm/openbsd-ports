Mozilla is an open-source web browser, designed for standards
compliance, performance and portability.

Mozilla looks for plugins in ~/.mozilla/plugins
${LOCALBASE}/mozilla/plugins
and ${LOCALBASE}/lib/mozilla-plugins.

To make it look good you probably want some nice anti-aliased fonts,
like ${PORTSDIR}/x11/bitstream-vera-fonts.
To disable xft altogether set GDK_USE_XFT=0 in the environment.
