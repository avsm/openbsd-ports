TenDRA is a C/C++ compiler developed, initially, by the DERA, the
Defense Evaluation and Research Agency in the United Kingdom.

A primary focus of the compiler is portability through conformance
to standard APIs (ANSI, ISO, POSIX1, POSIX2, XPG3, XPG4, SVID3,
UNIX95, among others).

The compiler has strong static checking capabilities, including the
ability to check programs for conformance to APIs which are not
directly supported by system headers.
