scli - SNMP Command Line Interface

The scli package was written to address the need for small and
efficient command line utilities to monitor and configure network
devices and host systems. The scli package is based on the SNMP
management protocol. It utilizes a MIB compiler called smidump to
generate C stub code.

In fact, virtually no SNMP knowledge is required in order to extend
the scli programs with new features.

The programs contained in the scli package try to be very specific
rather than generic. Generic SNMP tools such as MIB browsers or
simple command line tools (e.g. snmpwalk) are hard to use since
they expose too many protocol details. And in most cases, they fail
to present the information in a format that is easy to read and
understand.
