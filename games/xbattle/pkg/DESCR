xbattle is a concurrent multi-player game which combines elements of
strategy with arcade-like action to capture a wide range of military
scenarios.  The game is based on X11, which you must have installed to
run xbattle.  Opponents play from separate displays, with commands being
executed concurrently -- the players do not take "turns", but rather
they all issue their commands simultaneously.  There can be any number
of players, with each player assigned to a specific team, indicated by
marker colors.  The game board is a matrix of cells (square, hexes,
etc.) that can be occupied by colored troops, with the goal of the game
being to eliminate the enemy from the board by attacking cells occupied
by enemy troops.  A wide variety of command line options (and previously
configured game files) provide an abundance of different scenarios and
gaming environments.
