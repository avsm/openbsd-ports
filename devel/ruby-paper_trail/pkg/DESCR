PaperTrail lets you track changes to your models' data.  It's good for auditing
or versioning.  You can see how a model looked at any stage in its lifecycle,
revert it to any version, and even undelete it after it's been destroyed.

* Stores every create, update and destroy.
* Does not store updates which don't change anything
* Allows you to get at every version, including the original
* Stores everything in a single database table
