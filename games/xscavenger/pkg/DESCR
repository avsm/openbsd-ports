Scavenger is a cool arcade/thinking game very much like Lode
Runner.  You've got to run around and collect objects while
avoiding enemies.  Some objects are buried and you've got to
dig down to get at them.  It's an addictive game and some of
the levels are devilishly (cruelly) complicated to solve.
