 \fIlogfile\fR
 .PP The path plus basename of the logfile\&. If \fIlogfile\fR includes any '%' characters, it is treated as a format string for strftime(3)\&. Otherwise, the suffix \fI\&.nnnnnnnnnn\fR is automatically added and is the time in seconds\&. Both formats compute the start time from the beginning of the current period\&. For example, if a rotation time of 86400 is specified, the hour, minute, and second fields created from the strftime(3) format will all be zero, referring to the beginning of the current 24-hour period (midnight)\&. .PP When using strftime(3) filename formatting, be sure the log file format has enough granularity to produce a different file name each time the logs are rotated\&. Otherwise rotation will overwrite the same file instead of starting a new one\&. For example, if \fIlogfile\fR was /var/logs/errorlog\&.%Y-%m-%d with log rotation at 5 megabytes, but 5 megabytes was reached twice in the same day, the same log file name would be produced and log rotation would keep writing to the same file\&.
