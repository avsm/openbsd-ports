The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications
that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in.
Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available. The Readline library includes
additional functions to maintain a list of previously-entered command lines
to recall and perhaps reedit those lines, and perform csh-like history
expansion on previous commands.

The history facilites are also placed into a separate library, the History
library, as part of the build process.
The History library may be used without Readline in applications which desire
its capabilities.

To avoid any confusion with the base readline/history library make sure you
link to ereadline and ehistory.
In the headers you can check for RL_READLINE_VERSION, RL_VERSION_MAJOR and
RL_VERSION_MINOR to see which header you have picked up.
