Haml and Sass are templating engines for the two most common types of
documents on the web: HTML and CSS, respectively.
They are designed to make it both easier and more pleasant to code
HTML and CSS documents, by eliminating redundancy, reflecting the
underlying structure that the document represents, and providing
elegant, easily understandable, and powerful syntax.
