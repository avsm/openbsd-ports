Initial setup
=============

To configure a Trac environment, you must run the following command
and follow the prompts:
    trac-admin </path/to/projectenv> initenv

Here, "</path/to/projectenv>" is the location on your disk where you
want to place the project environment.

"</path/to/projectenv/conf/trac.ini>" is the configuration file of your
project environment which allows to setup the name of the project, etc.

To get started with Trac, you can use the built-in webserver, by running:
   tracd -p 8085 </path/to/projectenv>

Now you can open up a web brower and go to http://localhost:8085/. You
should see a single link for the project you just created. If you follow
the link, you should see trac in action.

Further information
===================

You can find the Trac Installation and Upgrade Guides here:

By default only Subversion is supported. Other VCS backends are
available as modules; see the documentation.
