This is nethack.  Will you dare explore the dungeon, kill creepy monsters,
and finish the game ?   At least, you're starting with a bonus: a puppy
(or a kitten) to help you.

If you find that game too easy, you may want to try slash instead.

- in order to use nethack with X11 graphics, you will have to add
${PREFIX}/lib/X11/fonts/hack to your fontpath, see xset(1) and Xserver(1), also
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm or /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xinit for proper configuration.

- the tty with colors mode expects a black background and white foreground to 
run properly, e.g., xterm -fg white -bg black

P.S. This is a very addictive game, with its whole wacky culture. And even
   a newsgroup dedicated to it (rec.games.roguelike.nethack). Don't say we
   didn't warn you !
