- configuration files are in		${SYSCONFDIR}/squid
- sample configuration files are in	${TRUEPREFIX}/share/examples/squid
- error message files are in		${TRUEPREFIX}/share/squid/errors
- sample error message files are in	${TRUEPREFIX}/share/examples/squid/errors
- icons are in 				${TRUEPREFIX}/share/squid/icons
- sample icons are in			${TRUEPREFIX}/share/examples/squid/icons
- the cache is in 			${SQUIDDIR}/cache
- logs are stored in 			${SQUIDDIR}/logs
- the ugid squid runs as is		_squid:_squid

Please remember to initialize the cache by running "squid -z" before
trying to run Squid for the first time.
