AT-SPI is the primary service interface by which assistive technologies
query and receive notifications from running applications.
This version of at-spi is a major break from previous versions.
It has been completely rewritten to use D-Bus rather than ORBIT / CORBA
for its transport protocol.

This package includes the protocol definitions for the new D-Bus at-spi.
Also included is the daemon neccessary for forwarding device events and
registering accessible applications.
