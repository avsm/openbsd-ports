The System Tools Backends (s-t-b for short) are a set of cross-platform
modules for Unix systems. The backends provide a common DBus interface
to all platforms to modify or read the system configuration in a system
independent fashion. Historically, access to system configuration has
varied deeply across Unix flavours, and concreting a bit more, across
Unix systems, making it near impossible to write desktop tools that
could work flawlessly in a cross-platform way. System Tools Backends try
to fill this gap, offering a generic and easy way for desktop
applications to read and modify configuration details.
