Subversion is a free/open-source version control system. That is,
Subversion manages files and directories over time. A tree of files
is placed into a central repository. The repository is much like an
ordinary file server, except that it remembers every change ever made
to your files and directories. This allows you to recover older versions
of your data, or examine the history of how your data changed.
In this regard, many people think of a version control system as a
sort of time machine.

Note that you need to install the following subpackages to gain
the appropriate functionality:
        -perl   Perl bindings to Subversion
        -python Python bindings to Subversion
        -ruby   Ruby bindings to Subversion
        -ap2    Apache httpd 2 modules for Subversion
        -gnome-keyring Support for the gnome-keyring password store

Also note that plaintext-password caching is disabled by default
by setting "store-plaintext-passwords" to "no" in ${SYSCONFDIR}/subversion/servers.
This is a different default behaviour to a standard subversion install,
which would ask the user before storing passwords in plaintext.
