Post-Install Notes for Majordomo
================================

Before you can use Majordomo, you will need to complete a few steps
manually:

	- read README, FAQ and NEWLIST in /usr/local/share/doc/majordomo

	- review /etc/majordomo/majordomo.cf

	- run '/usr/local/lib/majordomo/wrapper config-test'
	  as ordinary user (not root or majordom) to test your
	  installation.

	- make 'majordom' a trusted sendmail user so it can use 
	  parameter -f (changing the from address) without causing
	  a warning header. Read the documentation of the features
	  'confTRUSTED_USERS' and 'use_ct_file' in
	   /usr/share/sendmail/README.

	- add majordomo aliases to /etc/aliases (or create a
	  separate aliases file for majordomo, see sendmail
	  feature `ALIAS_FILE'). You will need at least the
	  following aliases:

		majordomo: "|/usr/local/lib/majordomo/wrapper majordomo"
		Majordomo-Owner: postmaster

Enjoy Majordomo!
