IPC::Run allows you run and interact with child processes
using files, pipes, and pseudo-ttys.  Both system()-style
and scripted usages are supported and may be mixed.  Like-
wise, functional and OO API styles are both supported and
may be mixed.

This is an heavy-weight module. Refer to IPC::Run3 to run
simple stuff with io redirections.
