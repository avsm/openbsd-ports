		Welcome to the OpenBSD ports collection.  
	For more information on the OpenBSD ports tree please visit

The OpenBSD ports tree is always growing. Therefor it is essential
that you continue to update your ports dir thru cvs or ftp.

If you are interested in creating a new port or contributing please 
visit
	http://www.openbsd.org/porting.html
If you would like to search for a given port, you can do so easily
by saying:

	make search key="<keyword>"

Which will generate a list of all ports matching <keyword>.

NOTE:  This tree can GROW significantly in size during normal usage!
The distribution tar files can and do accumulate in /usr/ports/distfiles,
and the individual ports will also use up lots of space in their work
subdirectories unless you remember to "make clean" after you're done
building a given port.  /usr/ports/distfiles can also be periodically
cleaned without ill-effect, though if you don't have the original
distribution tarball(s) for something on CDROM then you will need to pull
it all over your network connection again if you ever try to build the
associated port.
