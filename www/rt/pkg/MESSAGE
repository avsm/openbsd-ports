In order to complete your rt installations you will first need to initialize 
the database by following these steps.

Edit ${SYSCONFDIR}/rt3/RT_SiteConfig.pm and make the appropriate adjustments
for your database environment and then run 

# rt-setup-database --dba <yourdbauser> --action init \
	--prompt-for-dba-password

Once the database has been initialized you will need to configure httpd.  
Instructions for configuring httpd can be found in 
${PREFIX}/share/doc/rt3/README
