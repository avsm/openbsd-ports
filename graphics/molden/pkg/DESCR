Molden is a package for displaying molecular density from the ab initio
packages GAMESS-UK, GAMESS-US and GAUSSIAN and the semi-empirical packages
Mopac/Ampac.  Molden is capable of displaying molecular orbitals, the
electron density and the molecular minus atomic density. Molden supports
contour plots, 3-d grid plots with hidden lines and a combination of both.
It can write a variety of graphics instructions: postscript, XWindows,
VRML, povray, OpenGL, tekronix4014, hpgl, hp2392 and Figure.
