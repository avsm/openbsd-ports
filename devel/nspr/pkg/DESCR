Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides a platform-neutral
API for system level and libc like functions. The API is used
in the Mozilla client, many of Netscape/AOL/iPlanet's and other
software offerings.

NSPR provides platform independence for non-GUI operating
system facilities. These facilities include threads, thread
synchronization, normal file and network I/O, interval timing
and calendar time, basic memory management (malloc and free)
and shared library linking.
