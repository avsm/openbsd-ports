GAIM is a GTK+-based AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) application using
the tik/toc service from AOL.  It is actively being developed and
supports many common AOL features and should have an interface
familiar to anyone who has used AOL's AIM client before.  It also
has multiple protocol support for such things as ICQ, IRC, Yahoo!,
MSN Messenger, Jabber, and Napster.
