Napster is a protocol for sharing files between users. With Napster, the
files stay on the client machine, never passing through the server. The
server provides the ability to search for particular files and initiate
a direct transfer between the clients. In addition, chat forums similar
to IRC are available. OpenNap extends the Napster protocol to allow
sharing of any media type, and the ability to link servers together.
