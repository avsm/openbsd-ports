This is a simple hack, taken from FreeBSD, to OpenBSD's ls(1) to
use ANSI sequences to display file attributes in color.  There is
a -G flag (somewhat similar to the -F flag).  Take a look at the
man page for details.  The program is called "colorls", so you may
want to use an alias such as ls=${PREFIX}/bin/colorls.

Note that you need a color-capable terminal to enable colorls.  This
means you should set your TERM to "wsvt25" on the wscons(4) console
and to "xterm-xfree86" when using normal xterm, not "vt220" and
"xterm", respectively, which are not color-capable in termcap(5).
