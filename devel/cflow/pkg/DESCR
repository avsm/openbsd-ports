GNU cflow analyzes a collection of C source files and prints a graph,
charting control flow within the program.

GNU cflow is able to produce both direct and inverted flowgraphs for C
sources. Optionally a cross-reference listing can be generated. Two
output formats are implemented: POSIX and GNU (extended).

Input files can optionally be preprocessed before analyzing.

The package also provides Emacs major mode for examining the produced
flowcharts in Emacs. 

Note: this program is written in C and is not the same as cflow-2.x
which is a bash script using a lex and yacc generated parser.
