Monitord is a compact Perl-based tool for watching the health of UNIX
systems.  Monitord monitors the local system by watching the process
table, load average figures, the amount of free space in file systems,
and the output of custom monitoring scripts.

Monitord is not tied to any system management framework (e.g., HP
OpenView), and executes custom commands for producing its output.
Therefore, monitord can be plugged in to any existing monitoring
framework, provided the framework has a reasonable API, or used as a
standalone tool.

Monitord's configuration file resembles the configuration file of the
Net-SNMP agent, except a number of additional parameters.  However,
unlike any SNMP agent, monitord does not have to be polled for getting
results, but it rather produces asynchronous output events which is a
more scalable approach.  Monitord is also able to generate periodic
keepalive events, so its own health can be monitored by another
applicaton.
