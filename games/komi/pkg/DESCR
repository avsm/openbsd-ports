Komi is a 2D arcade game written in C, which uses the SDL library for
graphics and sound.  The aim of the game is to collect the money (in the
forms of coins and diamonds) floating about the screen.
Move Komi (the Space Frog) with the arrow keys, or keypad 4 and 6, or Q
and W, and extend his tongue with the spacebar, or the return key.
