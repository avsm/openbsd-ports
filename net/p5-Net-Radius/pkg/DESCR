This package contains the Net::Radius::Dictionary and
Net::Radius::Packet modules.

Net::Radius::Dictionary is a simple module that reads a RADIUS
dictionary file and parses it, allowing conversion between dictionary
names and numbers. Vendor-Specific attributes are supported in a
way consistent to the standards.

Net::Radius::Packet provides an interface to turn RADIUS packets
into Perl data structures and vice-versa.
