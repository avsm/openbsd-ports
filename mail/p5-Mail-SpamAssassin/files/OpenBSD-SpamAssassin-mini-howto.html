<p><b>Usage:</b><br>

You can use spamassassin in many ways. But the lightest for the machine is by
making use of the spamc/spamd combination.

<p>First let's add a user and group for the spamd.

<pre><b># useradd -s /usr/bin/false -b /nonexistent -u 506 -g =uid _spamdaemon</b></pre>

<p>Add this line to <b><code>/etc/rc.local</b></code>:
<pre><b># /usr/local/bin/spamd -u _spamdaemon -d -L -p 4321 -x</b></pre>
<br> Use that same line to start spamd now.

<p>The final step: put this at the top of your <b><code>.procmailrc</b></code>.
If you do not want to use procmail please check the

<ul><pre>
:0fw
* < 256000
| spamc -p 4321

:0e
{
EXITCODE=$?
}

:0:
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
caughtspam # This is the mailbox where all spam goes.</pre></ul>

<p><b>Customizing:</b><br>

The spam filtering is not perfect. But since the feedback is very extensive you
should be able to do what is necessary to get most spam filtered. 

<p>If you want to add custom settings to spamassassin you can create the 
file<code><b> /etc/spamassassin.cf </b></code>. All possible options are 
described in:<code><b> man Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf</b></code>
