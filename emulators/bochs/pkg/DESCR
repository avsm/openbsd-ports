Bochs is a portable x86 CPU emulation software that emulates
enough of the x86 CPU (by default it emulates 586 instruction set),
related AT hardware, and BIOS to run DOS, Windows 95/98, Minix 2.0 and
other OS's, all on your workstation.

Flavors:
	debug   - Build with Bochs' internal debugging support
	no_x11  - Do not build with X support
