Childsplay is a suite of educational games for young children, like
gcompris, but without the overkill of c/c++ and the GNOME environ.
Also the use of the SDL libraries makes smooth animation and the playing
of sound very easy.  Childsplay uses a plugin system for the games, so
you might want to check the Childsplay plugins page.
There are two built-in games: memory and a typing game.
