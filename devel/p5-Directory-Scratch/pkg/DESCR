When writing test suites for modules that operate on files, it's often
inconvenient to correctly create a platform-independent temporary
storage space, manipulate files inside it, then clean it up when the
test exits.  The inconvenience usually results in tests that don't work
everywhere, or worse, no tests at all.
This module aims to eliminate that problem by making it easy to do
things right.
