Use class and function decorators -- even in Python 2.3 (now with
source debugging for generated code)!  Want to use decorators, but
still need to support Python 2.3? Wish you could have class decorators,
decorate arbitrary assignments, or match decorated function signatures
to their original functions? Then you need "DecoratorTools".
