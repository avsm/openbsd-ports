Exim is a mail transfer agent (MTA) for hosts that are running Unix or Unix-
like operating systems. It was designed on the assumption that it would be run
on hosts that are permanently connected to the Internet. However, it can
be used on intermittently connected hosts with suitable configuration
adjustments.

This port can be built with the following flavors:

* no_exiscan		- do not build content scanning into the exim4
                          ACL system.
* no_x11		- do not build eximon which requires X11
* mysql			- support mysql queries for lookups
* postgresql		- support postgresql queries for lookups
* sqlite3		- support for sqlite queries for lookups
* ldap			- support ldap (OpenLDAP) queries for lookups
* iconv			- support character code conversions
* sasl			- support for SASL

All these flavors are independent of each other.
