Pyblosxom is a weblog engine that uses standard text files located on
your filesystem as a database of weblog entries. The concept is simple,
managing content is as easy as editing a text file with your favourite
text editor. It also supports publishing a blog as a set of static
HTML and RSS files, without the need for online executables (CGIs, etc).
