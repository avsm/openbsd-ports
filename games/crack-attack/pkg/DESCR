A free OpenGL game based on the Super Nintendo classic Tetris Attack.
Slowly, your stack of blocks grows from the bottom, and you've got to
make sure it never reaches the top. Because, once it does, you lose!
To eliminate blocks from the stack, line up at least three of one color,
horizontally or vertically.
To add to the excitement, chunks of red garbage will fall from above. It
is impossible to eliminate this garbage directly. However, if you
eliminate any blocks which are touching the garbage, the garbage will
shatter into normal, run-of-the-mill blocks.
