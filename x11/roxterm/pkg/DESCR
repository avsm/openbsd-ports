ROXTerm is a terminal emulator intended to provide similar features to
gnome-terminal, based on the same VTE library, but with a smaller
footprint and quicker start-up time. It achieves this by not using the
Gnome libraries and by using a separate applet to provide the
configuration GUI. It can be used as a ROX application, as the name
implies, or in any other X environment.
