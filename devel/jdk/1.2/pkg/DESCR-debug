Java (TM) 2 SDK, Standard Edition
Version 1.2.2

Debug Binaries

These binary files have been compiled with certain debugging options
enabled, to allow for more verbose debug information during 
development.  They are only really useful for porters of the SDK
itself, as they are much slower then the standard binaries.
