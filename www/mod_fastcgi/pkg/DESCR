mod_fastcgi is a module for the Apache web server, that enables
FastCGI - a standards based protocol for communicating with
applications that generate dynamic content for web pages.

FastCGI provides a superset of CGI functionality, but a subset of the
functionality of programming for a particular web server API.
Nonetheless, the feature set is rich enough for programming virtually
any type of web application, but the result is generally more
scalable.
