WWW::IndexParser is a module that uses LWP to fetch a URL from a web
server. It then attempts to parse this page as if it were an auto
generated index page. It returns an array of WWW::IndexParser::Entry
objects, one per entry in the directory index that it has found. Each
Entry has a set of methods: filename(), time(), size(), and others if
supported by the autoindex generated: type() and size_units().
