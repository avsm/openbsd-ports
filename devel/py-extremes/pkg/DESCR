The peak.util.extremes module provides a production-quality
implementation of the Min and Max objects from PEP 326. While PEP
326 was rejected for inclusion in the language or standard library,
the objects described in it are useful in a variety of applications.
In PEAK, they have been used to implement generic functions (in
RuleDispatch and PEAK-Rules), as well as to handle scheduling and
time operations in the Trellis. Because this has led to each project
copying the same code, we've now split the module out so it can be
used independently.
