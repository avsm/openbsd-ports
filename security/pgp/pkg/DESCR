	    Pretty Good Privacy version 2.6.3ia (international)
	    Pretty Good Privacy version 2.6.3a  (united states)

PGP 2.6.3[i]a is not an official PGP version. It is based on the source
code for MIT PGP 2.6.2 and has been modified for international use. PGP
2.6.3i (international) is probably illegal to use within the USA, but is
fine in almost every other country in the world.  PGP 2.6.3a can be
compiled from the same source and is legal even inside the USA.

All changes in the source that are not applicable within the USA are
enclosed in #ifdef's, thus enabling you to compile a PGP version that is
legal to use within the USA. This is accomplished by adding the -DUSA
option when building the program, and by linking it with the RSAREF
library (rsaglue2) rather than MPILIB (rsaglue1).   When compiled this
way PGP will identify itself as 2.6.3a.

For a more thorough installation and usage guide, refer to the file
setup.doc and the documentation for PGP 2.6.2, which is included
unmodified in the doc/ subdirectory that is created when you unpack the
distribution archive and installed in /usr/local/share/doc.
