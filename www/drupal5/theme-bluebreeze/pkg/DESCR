The bluebreeze theme combines style with good usability and clean interface.

    * It is based on the great .tpl-file structure of the zen theme.
    * Frando created the theme from a usability point of view.
    * Frando included some icons (all GPL or created by myself),
    because IMO icons, carefully used, can increase the usability
    and 'sexiness' of a theme in a good and unobtrusive way.
    * It's blue - because drupal is blue.
