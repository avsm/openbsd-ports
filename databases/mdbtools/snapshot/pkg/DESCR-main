in various settings.  

. libmdb    - the core library that allows access to MDB files programatically.
. libmdbsql - builds on libmdb to provide a SQL engine (ala Jet)
. utils     - provides command line utilities to list tables, export schema, 
              and data, show the version of the files, and other useful stuff.
. mdb-sql   - a command line SQL tool that allows one to type sql queries and
              get results.

In a separate package:
. gmdb2     - The GNOME MDB File Viewer and debugger.  Still alpha, but making
              great progress.

              Allows one to use MDB files with PHP for example.
