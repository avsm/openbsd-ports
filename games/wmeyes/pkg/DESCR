WMeyes is a pretty simple application: it sits in the Window Maker
dock, and a pair of eyes track your cursor.  Actually, the program
should work in all window managers, but then you don't have a dock
to sit it in, in which case you might as well use xeyes.

The 'time' parameter on the command line affects both the update
time of the pupil moving around, and the time it takes for the
eyelids to open or close.  These two can't be separated.

The standard method of starting it up under Window Maker is
'wmeyes -w -s &'.

'wmeyes -h' gives you usage info.
