circuit is a small game that shows circles with half-connecting lines.
By clicking on a circle, you can rotate all the lines protuding from
the circle.

The goal is to make all half-lines connect at the same time.

Usage: circuit [-t] [-6] width height

-t: torus map
-6: use hexagons instead of squares.
