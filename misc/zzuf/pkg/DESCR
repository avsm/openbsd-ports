zzuf is a transparent application input fuzzer. Its purpose is to find
bugs in applications by corrupting their user-contributed data (which
more than often comes from untrusted sources on the Internet). It works
by intercepting file and network operations and changing random bits in
the program's input. zzuf's behaviour is deterministic, making it easier
to reproduce bugs. Its main areas of use are:

* quality assurance: use zzuf to test existing software, or integrate it
  into your own software's testsuite
* security: very often, segmentation faults or memory corruption issues
  mean a potential security hole, zzuf helps exposing some of them
