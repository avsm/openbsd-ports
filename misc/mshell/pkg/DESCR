Mshell was written to shield users (and other non-Unix gurus, like
mathematicians and secretaries in the department) from "raw" Unix.  It
is as flexible as you can get (supports full shell capabilities like
pipes, etc. inside the menu commands) but simple to write menus for.
It is was developed for Nyx, a free, public access Unix system. 
Indeed, you're welcome to try Nyx -- log into Nyx as:

	- telnet to nyx.cs.du.edu (130.253.192.68), user 'new'.
	- call 303-871-3324
