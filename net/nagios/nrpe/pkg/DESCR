NRPE is an addon for Nagios that allows you to execute "local" plugins
(like check_disk, check_procs, etc.) on remote hosts. The check_nrpe
plugin is called from Nagios and makes plugin execution requests to the
NRPE daemon running on the remote host (either as a standalone daemon
or as a service under inetd). Supports passing command arguments to
server, as well as native SSL/TLS encryption (anonymous DH mode).
