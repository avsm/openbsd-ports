The dba module provides Drupal administrators with direct access
to their Drupal database tables from within the standard Drupal
user interface. It is possible to execute scripts to create and
alter tables, to backup one or more tables, to view/edit/delete
data within tables, and to empty or drop tables. If using MySQL,
it is also possible to check and repair tables.

Great tool to view your drupal tables and figure out how it works.

Be very careful with permissions!
