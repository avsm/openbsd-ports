To completely deinstall the pecl-memcache, you need
to disable the module by using the following command

    # ${LOCALBASE}/sbin/phpxs -r memcache

If you already have Apache running on your machine,
you should not use "apachectl restart" - instead,
you should fully stop and then restart the server.
