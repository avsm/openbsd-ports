This plugin scans a set of input traces and creates a separate pcap
trace file for each flow contained in the input traces. The output is
placed in a directory tree whose first level differentiates by IP
protocol, the second by source IP address, and the third by destination
IP address. Arbitrarily many input traces are supported.
