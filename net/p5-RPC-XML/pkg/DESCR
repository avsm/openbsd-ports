The RPC::XML package is an implementation of the XML-RPC standard.

The package provides a set of classes for creating values to pass to the
constructors for requests and responses.  These are lightweight objects,
most of which are implemented as tied scalars so as to associate specific
type information with the value.  Classes are also provided for requests,
responses, faults (errors) and a parser based on the XML::Parser package
from CPAN.
