PERSEUS library is an open source technology whose aim is to secure any
kind of communication streams against illegitimate or abusive
eavesdropping except for Nation State Security offices, provided that a
suitable, huge computing power is used (from tens of hours with a
supercomputer). PERSEUS enables to provide at the same time users' needs
for privacy and confidentiality while preserving the ability of security
agencies (police, defense, national security...) to eavesdrop
communications of really bad actors (terrorists, child pornographs...).
