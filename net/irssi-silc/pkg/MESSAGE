You need to change theme, otherwise you might experience problems related to
SILC-specific features (e.g. signed messages): /SET theme silc
You may want to run silc and silc-mime scripts when working with SILC:
	/SCRIPT LOAD silc
	/SCRIPT LOAD silc-mime

See ${PREFIX}/share/doc/irssi/silc/USAGE for more details
