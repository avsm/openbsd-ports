The FTE Text Editor is a powerful, yet very easy and intuitive to use
text editor for programmers. In fact, its features virtually make it a
complete IDE. It is small and fast.

Among many other things, it supports syntax highlighting and
syntax-aware autoindenting for many languages, parenthesis matching,
parsing of compiler output and folds. Most of its features are
configurable, including user-definable syntax highlighting through a
configurable state machine.

This port is based on a CVS snapshot, which includes Subversion support
in addition to CVS. Only the X11 version of FTE (xfte) is currently
functional.
