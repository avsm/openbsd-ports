To ensure correct operation, GnomeBaker needs to run with root privileges.
They are 2 ways to do so, either start it with sudo(8) or add the setuid
bit to the gnomebaker binary (not recommended).

You have to restart the GConf daemon by killing it before running
GnomeBaker for the first time.  As a regular user:
  gconftool-2 --shutdown && sudo gnomebaker
