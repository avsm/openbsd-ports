gitg is a git repository viewer targeting gtk+/GNOME. One of its main
objectives is to provide a more unified user experience for git
frontends across multiple desktops. It does this not be writing a
cross-platform application, but by close collaboration with similar
clients for other operating systems (like GitX for OS X).
