+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Copy the sample ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/examples/skippy/skippyrc-default to
your home directory as .skippyrc before running it.

If you encounter any BadAccess errors change the keysym value
(default F11) in .skippyrc to something else.

For a list of tested window-managers refer to the skippy homepage.
