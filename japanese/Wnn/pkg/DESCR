This is Wnn4.2, a Japanese/Chinese/Korean input method.  It is
included primarily so that we can compile mule-2.1, a multilingual
emacs.

Only the Japanese version is build for this port.

Note that binaries and libraries go to /usr/local, while man pages and 
includes go to /usr/X11R6.  That's the way it was designed, I don't
know why.

Mr. Yoshio KATAYAMA <kate@pfu.co.jp> fixed many bugs for Wnn4.2.
Patches for those are in 'Wnn4.2.patch.tar.gz' and are applied in this
port.

[Notice]
When compiling by this ports, if $LOCALBASE is not '/usr/local' and/or
$X11BASE is not '/usr/X11R6' then you should properly change two lines
'@cwd /usr/local' and '@cwd /usr/X11R6' in
$PORTSDIR/japanese/Wnn/pkg/PLIST.
