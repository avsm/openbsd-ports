MPlayer is a media player.  It plays most MPEG/VOB, AVI, ASF/WMA/WMV,
FLV, RM, QT/MOV/MP4, Ogg/OGM, MKV, VIVO, FLI, NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg,
FILM and RoQ files.  You can watch VCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, DivX 3/4/5,
WMV, and even H.264 movies, too.

MPlayer supports a wide range of video output drivers.  It works
with X11, Xv, OpenGL and optionally AAlib or SDL (and this way all
drivers of SDL).  Most of them support software or hardware scaling,
so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen.
