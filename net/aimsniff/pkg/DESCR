AIM Sniff is a utility for monitoring and archiving AOL Instant
Messenger messages across a network.  You can either do a live dump
(actively sniff the network) or read a PCAP file and parse the file for
IM messages.  You also have the option of dumping the information to a
MySQL database, a flat file, STDOUT, or any combination of the three.
AIM Sniff allows administrators to see how often users are chatting to
monitor for abuse and you can also use AIM Sniff to monitor for cases of
harassment or pirated software trading.
