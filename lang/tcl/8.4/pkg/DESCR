"Routine maintenance of Tcl/Tk 8.4 has now come to an end.  We intend
Tcl/Tk 8.4.19 to be the final 8.4.* releases.  The current stable
releases of Tcl/Tk are 8.5.2, and development has begun on Tcl/Tk 8.6.
It is possible that a bug fix of great enough importance or severity
might prompt a release of 8.4.20, but there is no plan for that at the
moment.  Even that level of support will fade away quickly."
