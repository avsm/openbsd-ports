Palm OS Emulator is an application that emulates the hardware for most
Palm Computing Platform Hardware devices (e.g., Pilot, PalmPilot, Palm
III, Palm V, Palm VII, etc.).

With the Palm OS Emulator, you can emulate the functions of a Palm
hardware device, including running the built-in application, as well as
installing and running 3rd party applications.

To use the Palm OS Emulator you will also need to download the Emulator
Skins from http://www.palmos.com/dev/tools/emulator/ and you need to
get hold of a Palm OS ROM Image.
