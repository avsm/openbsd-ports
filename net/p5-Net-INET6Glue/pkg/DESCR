Net::INET6Glue is a collection of modules to make common modules
IPv6 ready by hotpatching them.

Unfortunately the current state of IPv6 support in perl is that no
IPv6 support is in the core and that a lot of important modules
(like Net::FTP, Net::SMTP, LWP,...) do not support IPv6 even if the
modules for IPv6 sockets Socket6, IO::Socket::INET6 are available.

Net::INET6Glue is a hack to make more of Perl IPv6 able.  This is
partly done by replacing IO::Socket::INET with IO::Socket::INET6
and by adding IPv6 Protocol functionality to Net::FTP.  Works for
Net::SMTP, LWP, Net::FTP and probably others too.
