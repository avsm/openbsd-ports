Yorick is an interpreted language for scientific computing and
numerical analysis, very similar to Matlab.

Yorick has a compact syntax, similar to C, but with array operators.
It is easily expandable through dynamic linking of C libraries,
allows efficient manipulation of arbitrary size/dimension arrays,
and offers extensive graphic capabilities.

Yorick includes an interactive graphics package, and a binary file
package capable of translating to and from the raw numeric formats
of all modern computers.
