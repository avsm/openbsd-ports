Community-ID is an OpenID implementation in PHP which is OpenID 2.0
compliant. Users can keep track of their trusted sites and manage them.
For Community-ID administrators statistics are available to track
registration of new users, authorized users per day or the number of
trusted sites. Administrators can set the site in maintenance mode or
send emails to all registered users.
