A source distribution of Kerberos 4. It is based on eBones (which is
based on MIT Kerberos 4 patchlevel 9), but has been severely hacked
and is known to work on the following systems (these are what we use
it on):

     Digital UNIX 3.2 and 4.0 
     SunOS 4.1 
     SunOS 5.4/5.5/5.6 (aka Solaris 2.4/2.5/2.6) 
     AIX 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 
     NetBSD 1.2, 1.3 
     FreeBSD 2.2 
     IRIX 5.3, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4 
     Linux 2.0 
     HP-UX 9.x, 10.x 
     Ultrix 4.4 
     BSD/OS 2.0 and 2.1 
     Cray UNICOS 9 
     Fujitsu UXP/V 

Apart from the core Kerberos programs the distribution contains the following: 

     telnet and telnetd, rsh, rcp, rlogin and rshd, rlogind, login, su
     ftp and ftpd following (mostly) the ftpsec Internet draft. 
     kauth (kinit + afs support + remote kinit (like rkinit) + batch support) 
     kpopper and an emacs 19.30 movemail with kpop support 
     kx for encrypted X sessions, xnlock,
     kip for encrypted IP tunnels (requires tunnel device) 
     afslog (aklog clone), pagsh, and kstring2key for the AFS minded 
     authentication modules for Irix, Digital UNIX, and PAM.
