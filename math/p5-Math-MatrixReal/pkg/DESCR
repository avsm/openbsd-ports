Math::MatrixReal implements the data type "matrix of reals" (and
consequently also "vector of reals") which can be used almost like any
other basic Perl type thanks to OPERATOR OVERLOADING.

Also features many important operations and methods: matrix norm, matrix
transposition, matrix inverse, determinant of a matrix, order and
numerical condition of a matrix, scalar product of vectors, vector
product of vectors, vector length, projection of row and column vectors,
a comfortable way for reading in a matrix from a file, the keyboard or
your code, and many more.
