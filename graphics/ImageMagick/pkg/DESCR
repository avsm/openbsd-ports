ImageMagick is an X11 package for display and interactive manipulation
of images.  The package includes tools for image conversion, annotation,
composition, animation, and creating montages.  ImageMagick can read and
write many of the more popular image formats (e.g. JPEG, TIFF, PNM, XPM,
Photo CD, etc.).
