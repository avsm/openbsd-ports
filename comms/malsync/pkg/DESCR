malsync is built on the MAL (Mobile Application Link) protocol
developed by/for AvantGo.com's site and customers.

Generally, sites that are registered through avantgo provide formatted
content to avantgo end users.  Any site may be synced to the palm
through this library, though.

You'll need a a personal AvantGo account from [2].

This is the first release of the code, and is still considered
"unsupported" by avantgo.  Please direct all questions to either
the port maintainer, or email addresses in the src (and not to
avantgo's help desk).
