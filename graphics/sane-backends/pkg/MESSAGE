Before using this program, make sure you read the
${PREFIX}/share/doc/sane-backends/PROBLEMS file.

With some USB backends, the OpenBSD uscanner driver does not support
getting USB vendor and product ids. To make your scanner work with sane,
you'll have to disable uscanner in your kernel - see config(8) - which
will allow libusb to claim your device instead.

Some backends (like plustek) use a lockfile for allowing multiple access
to one scanner. If using such a backend, you must add yourself to the
_saned group or you will not be able to scan.

If you're planning on using the SANE network daemon (saned), add the
following line in /etc/services:
sane-port 6566/tcp saned # SANE network scanner daemon
