libchewing is derived from Chewing input method, a xcin module
focusing on intelligent phonetic processing by Lu-chuan Kung
(lckung) and Kang-pen Chen (kpchen). However, the original
authors of Chewing dropped its development, and Chewing was
highly bonded with xcin, which prevents from wider applications.
