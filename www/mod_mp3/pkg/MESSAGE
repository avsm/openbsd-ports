To finish the install of mod_mp3, you need
to enable the module by using the following command

  ${PREFIX}/sbin/${MODAPACHE_ENABLE}

A sample configuration has been copied to:
/var/www/conf/modules.sample/mp3.conf

Modify the sample configuration and create a symbolic link:
ln -s /var/www/conf/modules.sample/mp3.conf \
	/var/www/conf/modules/mp3.conf

If you already have Apache running on your machine,
you should not use "apachectl restart" - instead,
you should fully stop and then restart the server.
