ANSI terminal support for Haskell, which allows: 

* Cursor movement
* Screen and line clearing
* Color output
* Showing or hiding the cursor
* Changing the console title (though this is not strictly part of
  ANSI, it is widely supported in Unix)

It is compatible with Windows (via an emulation layer) and those
Unixes with ANSI terminals.
