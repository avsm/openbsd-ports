This module allows the use of objects without classes, like in
some lesser known object languages based on prototyping.

Instead of having to define classes with methods, one
creates new objects by cloning existing objects, and then
adding methods (and attributes) explicitly to a given object.

`Inheritance' is achieved through object lineage: an object
has been cloned from a line of ancestors, and any method
not found in an object will be looked up in the object's line
of ancestors.
