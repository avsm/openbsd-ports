The Easy Publish and Consume library provides an easy method to:

    * Publish data using HTTPS: EpcPublisher;
    * Announce that information via DNS-SD: EpcDispatcher;
    * find that information: EpcConsumer;
    * And finally consume it.

You can use this library as a key/value store published to the network,
using encryption, authentication and service discovery.
