To completely deinstall the ap2-subversion package you
need to perform these steps as root:

       edit ${SYSCONFDIR}/apache2/httpd2.conf
       remove the lines: LoadModule dav_svn_module
                         LoadModule authz_svn_module

Do not do this if you plan on re-installing the ap2-subversion
package at some future time.
