EventMachine is a Ruby library providing event-driven I/O using the
Reactor pattern. EventMachine is designed to simultaneously meet
two key needs:

    * Extremely high scalability, performance and stability for the
      most demanding production environments; and
    * An API that eliminates the complexities of high-performance
      threaded network programming, allowing engineers to
      concentrate on their application logic. 

This unique combination makes EventMachine a premier choice for
designers of critical networked applications, including web servers
and proxies, email and IM production systems,
authentication/authorization processors, and many more.
