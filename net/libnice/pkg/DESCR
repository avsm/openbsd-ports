libnice is an implementation of the IETF's draft Interactice 
Connectivity Establishment standard (ICE). It provides GLib-based 
library, libnice and GStreamer elements.

ICE is useful for applications that want to establish peer-to-peer 
UDP data streams. It automates the process of traversing NATs and 
provides security against some attacks.

Existing standards that use ICE include Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) and XMPP Jingle.
