DRIconf is a configuration applet for the Direct Rendering
Infrastructure. It allows customizing performance and visual quality
settings of OpenGL drivers on a per-driver, per-screen and/or
per-application level.

The settings are stored in system wide and per-user XML configuration
files, which are parsed by the OpenGL drivers on startup.
