aircrack is an 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK keys cracking program that can recover
keys once enough data packets have been captured.

It implements the standard FMS attack along with some optimizations
like KoreK attacks, thus making the attack much faster compared to
other WEP cracking tools. In fact, aircrack is a set of tools for
auditing wireless networks.
