You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
  # ln -s ../lists /var/www/htdocs/lists
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

Basic configuration of PHPlist cwmust be is done by editing the file
${INSTDIR}/config/config.php.

Enable the MySQL and IMAP extensions of PHP5 and create a database for phplist
named phplistdb with username/password phplist/phplist and access the admin
interface of PHPlist at

http://localhost/lists/admin/

Make sure PHP5 can connect to the MySQL server through a local socket.
