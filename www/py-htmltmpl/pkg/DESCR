The purpose of the templating engine is to provide web application
developers, who need to separate program code and design (HTML code) of
their web application projects, with a templating tool that can be
easily used by cooperating webdesigners who have no programming skills.

Templating language provided by the engine is inspired by Perl
templating module HTML::Template. Templates created for HTML::Template
can be used with this engine in case they do not violate character case
rules of htmltmpl.

This package includes easydoc, a module which uses the templating engine
to generate HTML documentation from docstrings embedded in source files
of Python modules.
