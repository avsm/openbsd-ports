| Mailman needs quite some configuration. Have a look at
| ${PREFIX}/share/doc/mailman/README.OpenBSD to find out
| what you have to do, to get mailman up and running.
|
| If you are upgrading from mailman 2.0.x make sure to read
| ${PREFIX}/share/doc/mailman/UPGRADING and run 
| ${PREFIX}/lib/mailman/bin/update as root.
