The WMdock plugin is a compatibility layer for running WindowMaker
dockapps on the XFCE desktop. It integrates the dockapps into a panel,
closely resembling the look and feel of the WindowMaker dock or clip,
respectively.
You should set the size of the panel which is going to swallow the
plugin to something larger than 64 pixels. Start your invaluable
dockapps, WMdock will swallow them.
