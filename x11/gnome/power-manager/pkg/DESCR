GNOME Power Manager is a GNOME session daemon that acts as a policy
agent on top of UPower. It listens for system events and responds with
user-configurable actions.
GNOME Power Manager comes in three main parts:
- gnome-power-manager:      the manager daemon itself
- gnome-power-preferences:  the control panel program, for configuration
- gnome-power-statistics:   the statistics graphing program
