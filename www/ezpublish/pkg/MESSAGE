eZ Publish has been installed into ${INSTDIR}.

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
   # ln -s ../ezpublish /var/www/htdocs/ezpublish
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted by default)

You can ensure you have a working install by accessing:
http://<localhost>/ezpublish/
