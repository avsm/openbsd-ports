The PDF functions in PHP can create PDF files using the PDFlib
library created by Thomas Merz. PDFlib is available for download
at http://www.pdflib.com/pdflib/index.html, but requires that you
purchase a license for commercial use.

All of the functions in PDFlib and the PHP module have identical
function names and parameters. You will need to understand some of
the basic concepts of PDF and PostScript to efficiently use this
extension. All lengths and coordinates are measured in PostScript
points. There are generally 72 PostScript points to an inch, but
this depends on the output resolution. Please see the PDFlib
documentation included with the source distribution of PDFlib for
a more thorough explanation of the coordinate system used.
