The Darwin Streaming Proxy is an application-specific proxy which would
normally be run in a border zone or perimeter network. It is used to give
client machines within a protected network access to streaming servers
outside that network, in the case when the firewall blocks RTSP
connections or RTP/UDP data flow.
