XDrawChem is a two-dimensional molecule drawing program for Unix
operating systems.  It is similar in functionality to other molecule
drawing programs such as ChemDraw (TM, CambridgeSoft).  It can read and
write MDL Molfiles, and read ChemDraw text and binary files, to allow
sharing between XDrawChem and other chemistry applications, and it can
create images in popular formats like PNG and EPS.
