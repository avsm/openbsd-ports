Processing is an open source programming language and environment for
people who want to create images, animations, and interactions.
Initially developed to serve as a software sketchbook and to teach
fundamentals of computer programming within a visual context, Processing
also has evolved into a tool for generating finished professional work.
Today, there are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers,
researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning, prototyping,
and production.
