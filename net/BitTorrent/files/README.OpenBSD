To begin using BitTorrent quickly, simply fetch a torrent file and
run btdownloadgui (X11) or btdownloadcurses:

$ ftp http://www.somesite.com/some.torrent
$ btdownloadcurses some.torrent

Note that for machines behind NAT, you will need to pass in the ports
outlined in README.txt.  An example pf.conf stub for doing this is:

rdr on $ext_if inet proto tcp from any to $ext_ip port 6881:6889 -> \
	$BitTorrentmachine port 6881:*
