Qt is a toolkit for building a GUI for X in C++. 
There are some user documentation files in ${QT_DOC}, but
the main documentation is in the qt2-html package, 
or on the web (${HOMEPAGE}).

There is also a qt2-examples package, that contains a tutorial and 
simple example programs (source + binaries).


People who want to use qt2 to compile applications outside the ports tree
should note that qt2's installation conforms to OpenBSD habits, not
TrollTech's recommendations.
Accordingly:
- libs are separated from includes.
- moc is installed as ${PREFIX}/bin/moc2, in order not to conflict with
  other qt versions.

Generally, it's just a question of invoking 

env MOC=moc2 configure --with-qt-includes=${PREFIX}/include/X11/qt2 
	--with-qt-libraries=${PREFIX}/lib/qt2

Or to force MOC in your make/gmake invocation:
make MOC=moc2
will override the Makefile contents.

Warning: the qt2 library also appears under ${PREFIX}/lib, but you
*must* make sure your application sees ${PREFIX}/lib/qt2 *first*, because
${PREFIX}/lib may also contain qt3, in which case the linker will pick up
the most recent library.

The qt packages currently do not include mt versions of qt, because of
insufficient testing.
