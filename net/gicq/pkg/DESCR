For lack of a better name, I'm referring to this program as "gicq",
since it's intended to eventually be a clone of the popular chat client
"ICQ" by Mirabilis Ltd. (http://www.mirabilis.com) and it utilizes the
GTK toolkit (http://www.gtk.org).

You must already have an ICQ number to use this.  When you launch
gicq, choose "Online" from the status selector at the bottom of the
window.  The first time, you'll be prompted for your ICQ number and
password.  IMPORTANT: you must enter your ICQ number - NOT your
nickname.
