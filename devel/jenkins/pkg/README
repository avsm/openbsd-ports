| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To arrange for the standalone Jenkins server to run automatically
on reboot, add "jenkins" to "pkg_scripts" in /etc/rc.conf.local, e.g.:

pkg_scripts="${pkg_scripts} jenkins"

NOTE: This script runs Jenkins on port 8000, not 8080, since most
Java application servers run on port 8080. By default we disable
HTTPS and AJP, since the former is extra overhead on localhost and
the latter conflicts with most Java application servers' AJP port.

To change any of these options, carefully copy the line
starting daemon_flags= from /etc/rc.d/jenkins into /etc/rc.conf.local
and change the daemon_flags to jenkins_flags in addition to any
changes to the ports and other options.

To run Jenkins in another Java web/application server, copy the war
file from ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/jenkins to your server's deploy
directory, or read more at ${HOMEPAGE}. 

To use the email notifications, you will have to configure a valid
sending address (and SMTP server, if not localhost) under
Manage Jenkins -> Email Configuration.

The Jenkins data files are in the home directory (/var/jenkins),
under the "hidden" directory ".jenkins".

If you are upgrading from Hudson to Jenkins, you can copy the old
content of /var/hudson/.hudson into /var/jenkins/.jenkins, e.g.,
	# cp -r /var/hudson/.hudson/* /var/jenkins/.jenkins
	# chown -R _jenkins:_jenkins /var/jenkins/.jenkins
