Icecast is a streaming media server which currently supports Ogg-based
streams like Vorbis, Speex, FLAC, Midi and Theora, as well as MP3 and
various others (even NSV Shoutcast streams). It can be used to create
an Internet radio station or a privately run jukebox and many things
inbetween. It is very versatile and supports open standards for
communication and interaction.

Icecast v2 is a complete rewrite of the old Icecast streaming server.
It was designed to be highly efficient and have low memory requirements.
