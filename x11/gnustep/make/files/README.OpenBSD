# post-install optionnal steps
#

To take advantage of all the features from the GNUstep framework, you
should add the following lines to your ~/.xsession or ~/.xinitrc:
 . !!PREFIX!!/share/GNUstep/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh # (from gnustep-base)
 !!PREFIX!!/bin/gdnc # notifications daemon (from gnustep-base)
 !!PREFIX!!/bin/gpbs # clipboard/pasteboard daemon (from gnustep-back)


To enable gdomap(8), the distributed objects lookup daemon (from
gnustep-base), add the following lines to services(5):
 gdomap 538/tcp # GNUstep distrib objects
 gdomap 538/udp # GNUstep distrib objects

Then see rc(8) to have "!!PREFIX!!/bin/gdomap -p" launched at boot time.

#
# running applications
#

While opening GNUstep applications using their complete path is possible
(i.e. !!PREFIX!!/libexec/GNUstep/ApplicationName.app/ApplicationName),
you're advised to use the "openapp" wrapper to do so.
For instance, to start the Calculator application, you would use:
 !!PREFIX!!/bin/openapp Calculator


According to your display, you may find the fonts to be too large/small
for your taste.
To change the default fonts size ("9"), use the following command:
 !!PREFIX!!/bin/defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSFontSize <fontsize>
