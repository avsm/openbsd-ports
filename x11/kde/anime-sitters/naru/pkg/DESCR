This is Narusegawa from Love Hina (an anime series). I haven't
drawn it: I took the images from a  windows sitter found in 
http://www.lovehina.zonaxtrema.net/ . Aparently they dont have
copyright (I even tried running strings on the windows binary, but as
it comes from Japan, it wouldnt work anyway) because if you right click
on it (the windows sitter, of course!) it says "(C)_________________"
as if the author havent put it. Whatever.

Have fun!
