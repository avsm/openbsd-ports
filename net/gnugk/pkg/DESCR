The GNU Gatekeeper is an open-source project that implements an H.323
gatekeeper. A gatekeeper provides call control services to the H.323
endpoints. It is an integral part of most useful internet telephony
installations that are based on the H.323 standard.
According to the recommendations from H.323, GnuGK provides most of the
following functions based on the OpenH323 protocol stack:
 * Address Translation
 * Admissions Control
 * Bandwidth Control
 * Zone Management
 * Call Control Signaling
 * Call Authorization
