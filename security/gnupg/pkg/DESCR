GnuPG is a complete and free replacement for PGP. Because it does
not use IDEA or RSA it can be used without any restrictions. GnuPG
is nearly in compliance with RFC2440 (OpenPGP).

Flavors:
	idea - build with IDEA support
	card - build with OpenPGP card support
	ldap - build with LDAP keyserver support
