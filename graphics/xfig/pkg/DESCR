XFIG - Facility for Interactive Generation of figures under X11

Xfig is a menu-driven tool that allows the user to draw and manipulate objects
interactively in an X window.  The resulting pictures can be saved, printed
on postscript printers or converted to a variety of other formats (e.g. to
allow inclusion in LaTeX documents).

To enjoy the beautiful colors, specify "*customization: -color" in your 
.Xdefaults or .Xresources file.
