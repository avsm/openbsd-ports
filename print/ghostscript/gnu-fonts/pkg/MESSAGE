To install these fonts for X11, just make sure that the fontpath
lists the 75dpi or 100dpi bitmap fonts before the ghostscript fonts,
and make sure you have the string ":unscaled" appended to the bitmap
font's fontpath. This way, the bitmap fonts will be used if they
match, and the Type 1 versions will be used if the font needs to be
scaled. Below is the relevant section from a typical xorg.conf file.

   FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"
   FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/:unscaled"
   FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/:unscaled"
   FontPath   "${PREFIX}/share/ghostscript/fonts/"
   FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/"
