Qpopper supports the widely used POP3 protocol for downloading Internet
e-mail used by many popular e-mail clients. Qopper does not include a
message transfer agent or SMTP support and normally works with standard
UNIX mail transfer agents such as sendmail or smail.

Qpopper supports APOP, an alternate authentication method.  It is able
to authenticate without passing the password in cleartext over the wire.
