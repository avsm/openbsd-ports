To use kpoppassd, you must add the following lines
to /etc/services:

    poppassd	106/tcp # Eudora compatible password Server

and to /etc/inetd.conf:

    127.0.0.1:poppassd stream tcp nowait root \
        ${PREFIX}/libexec/kpoppassd kpoppassd

Then, you must (re)start inetd as root.
kpoppassd uses the LOG_LOCAL4 syslog facility for logging.
