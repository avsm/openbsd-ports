The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function
when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout
has been reached.

libevent is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in
event driven network servers. An application just needs to call
event_dispatch() and can then add or remove events dynamically without
having to change the event loop.
