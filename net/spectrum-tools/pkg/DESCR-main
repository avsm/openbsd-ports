Spectrum-Tools is a set of utilities for using the Wi-Spy USB spectrum
analyzer tools from Metageek LLC (http://www.metageek.net). They include
userspace drivers for the hardware (implemented via libusb), a graphing 
UI built on GTK/Cairo, network servers for remote devices, and simple 
utilities for developing additional tools.

This package contains the GTK user interface, spectool_gtk.
Non-GUI tools can be found in the spectrum-tools-utils package.
