The Cyrus SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer)

SASL is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method for adding
authentication support to connection-based protocols. To use SASL, a
protocol includes a command for identifying and authenticating a user to a
server and for optionally negotiating protection of subsequent protocol
interactions. If its use is negotiated, a security layer is inserted
between the protocol and the connection.

The following mechanisms are included in this distribution:

	ANONYMOUS
	CRAM-MD5
	DIGEST-MD5
	GSSAPI (MIT Kerberos 5 or Heimdal Kerberos 5)
	KERBEROS_V4
	PLAIN

The library can use a Berkeley DB, gdbm or ndbm file on the server side to
store per-user authentication secrets.  The utility saslpasswd has been
included for adding authentication secrets to the file.
