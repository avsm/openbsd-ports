<h3>Theoretical part:</h3>

<p>Before you start to use bmf it is a good thing to know  a  little bit about
   the theoretical background of
   <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html">Bayesian spamfiltering</a>.


<h3>Training bmf:</h3>

<p>Lets take a look at this basic <tt class="FILENAME">.procmailrc</tt> example.

<dl><dd><pre>
:0fw
* &lt; 256000
| bmf -p

:0e
{
EXITCODE=$?
}

:0:
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
zspam # This is the mailbox where all spam goes.

:0w
inbox # This is your inbox</pre></dd></dl>


<p>bmf will now sort your mail in a spam and non-spam folder. Training
   bmf means you have to tell it when it has made a mistake.

As an example you can add these shortcuts to your <tt class="FILENAME">.muttrc</tt>

<dl><dd><pre>
macro index &lt;f3&gt; "|bmf -S\n&lt;save-message&gt;=zspam\n" "SPAM"
macro index &lt;f4&gt; "|bmf -N\n&lt;save-message&gt;=inbox\n" "NOT SPAM"
macro pager &lt;f3&gt; "|bmf -S\n&lt;save-message&gt;=zspam\n" "SPAM"
macro pager &lt;f4&gt; "|bmf -N\n&lt;save-message&gt;=inbox\n" "NOT SPAM"
</pre></dd></dl>

<p>Now you can press the F3 button to tell bmf a message in your inbox
   is spam ( <tt class="FILENAME">bmf -S</tt> ) and move it to your
   spam-folder. If you find a non-spam message in your spam-folder you
   can press F4 and bmf will unregister the message as spam and put it
   in your normal mailfolder.

<h3>Feeding a spam-archive to bmf:</h3>
<p>To speed up the process of feeding  the  bmf-database  you  can  also
   download a recent
   <a href="http://www.em.ca/~bruceg/spam/">spam archive</a>
   and run the files in the archive through the following one-liner:

<dl><dd><pre>for i in * ; do bmf -s -i $i; done</pre></dd></dl>

<p>This method is not recommended by the author since the headers of a
   message are also taken in account. And the headers of the messages
   from a spam-archive do not match yours. But I had good results with
   this method.

<h3>Mixing with SpamAssassin:</h3>

<p>You can also mix bmf with
   <a  href="http://spamassassin.org">SpamAssassin</a>.
   bmf is much lighter than spamassassin but SpamAssassin does not have
   to be trained. You can actually use SpamAssassin to train bmf. Change
   your <tt class="FILENAME">.procmailrc</tt> to something like this:

<dl><dd><pre>
:0fw
* &lt; 256000
| bmf -p

:0e
{
EXITCODE=$?
}

:0:
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
zspam-bmf


:0fw
* &lt; 256000
| spamc -p 4321 -f

:0e
{
EXITCODE=$?
}

:0:
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
{
  :0c
  | spamassassin -d | bmf -S
  :0
  zspam-sa
}

:0w
inbox</pre></dd></dl>

<p>All spam caught by bmf will be send to the zspam-bmf folder. All spam
   missed by bmf but caught by SpamAssassin will be fed to bmf for
   training and then send to the zspam-sa folder.
