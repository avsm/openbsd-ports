Subclipse is an Eclipse 3.x IDE plugin that adds Subversion integration
to the Eclipse IDE.  It works largely the same as the Team->CVS
functionality, e.g., a SVN Repository window, Team->Subversion menu
items, and so on.

Subclipse itself is licensed under the terms of the Common Public
License (CPL) 1.0.  This port includes the pure-Java client adapter
JavaSVN from http://tmate.org/svn/ (which unfortunately has a more
restrictive license) so there is no C/C++ compilation required to
build this port; it should work anywhere that Java and Eclipse have
been ported.
