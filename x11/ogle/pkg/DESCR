Ogle is a dvd player with support for menus and 
subtitles.  Currently, it lacks some audio formats
support (PCM and ???), so a few DVDs will work
with sound.

As shipped, ogle cannot descramble DVDs. There are
a few DVDs out there with no scramble protection.
However, ogle will recognize and use an installed
descrambling library.

To run ogle, you need a graphics card well supported 
by XFree, including the Xvideo extension in YUV mode,
and a sound card with 48KHz output (ATI card owners
may wish to use the ATI-4.1.0.i386.tgz package)
You can check your display Xvideo capabilities with
xdpyinfo (presence of the Xvideo extension) and
xvinfo (presence of an adapter with YUV capabilities).


Alternately, at the expense of more cpu power,
ogle can also use systemV shared memory, but the
shared memory requirements exceed GENERIC parameters.
You will need to crank them up. Configure a kernel with
option 	SHMMAXPGS=4096
and edit param.c to set SHMSEG to 16, then recompile.


The graphical interface add-on  ogle-gui currently
does not work on OpenBSD, but the program can be fully
controlled from the keyboard anyways, see oglerc(5).

Overall, ogle needs about 50% cpu for full-framerate decoding
on a PIII700 with an ATI Mach64 Mobility and an ESS 
Maestro 2.

If Xvideo YUV is not available, ogle roughly needs 100% cpu
on the same machine, and full screen rescale is not available.
