This module attempts to extract the maximum amount of content from
available documents, and is less concerned with XML compliance than
alternatives.  Rather than rely on XML::Parser, it uses heuristics and
good old-fashioned Perl regular expressions.  It stores the data in a
simple hash structure, and "aliases" certain tags so that when done,
you can count on having the minimal data necessary for re-constructing
a valid RSS file.  This means you get the basic title, description,
and link for a channel and its items.
