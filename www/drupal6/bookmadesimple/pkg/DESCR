This module will create a main book page for content type selected in
BookMadeSimple settings. This is a shortcut to create a node and click
on Update book outline.
A dropdown listbox will be added in books links. Only allowed content-
type (define in content-type settings) are printed. Selecting a content
type will add it as a child page of the book page.
