This features:

* amor - a neko-like clone, with cute characters that sit on your windows
borders (apparently only works with a kde desktop).
* kaphorism: displays aphorisms
* kodo - a mouse odometer.
* kteatime - timer to prepare tea.
* kmoon - phases of the moon-type program.
* ktux: Tux-in-a-Spaceship screen saver
* kworldclock: application and kicker applet showing daylight area on the world
               globe

Mostly completely useless.
