The manpage of GnuPG mentions the need for memory page locking.
In fact this is not needed as OpenBSD enables swap file encryption
by default.

However you might want to get rid of the misleading 'using insecure
memory' warning. Just put 'no-secmem-warning' into your ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
file or use gpg with the --no-secmem-warning switch.
