Logstalgia is a website traffic visualization that replays or streams
Apache web-server access logs as a pong-like battle between the web
server and an never ending torrent of requests.

Requests appear as colored balls (the same color as the host) which
travel across the screen to arrive at the requested location. Successful
requests are hit by the paddle while unsuccessful ones (eg 404 - File
Not Found) are missed and pass through.

The paths of requests are summarized within the available space by
identifying common path prefixes. Related paths are grouped together
under headings. For instance, by default paths ending in png, gif or jpg
are grouped under the heading Images. Paths that don't match any of the
specified groups are lumped together under a Miscellaneous section.
