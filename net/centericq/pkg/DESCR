A curses-based textmode ICQ client implementation. It is a
fully featured client, can do things like file transfer. Has
the ability to associate sounds with different actions/evens
and play them through a sound card, as well as the standart
beeping.

Things like colors are not hard-coded in the program itself,
but can be set in the corresponding config files.
