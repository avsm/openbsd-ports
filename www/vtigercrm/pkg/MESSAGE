The vtiger CRM has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
   # ln -s ../vtigercrm /var/www/htdocs/vtigercrm
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

*** For initial installation only, skip this section when updating! ***
To complete the installation, you must create an empty MySQL database
and grant a corresponding user all privileges to it.
Then point your web browser to:
http://<localhost>/vtigercrm/install.php
