Files to facilitate the generation of a self-signed
certificate and key for Dovecot have been installed:
/etc/ssl/dovecot-openssl.cnf (Edit this accordingly!)
${PREFIX}/sbin/dovecot-mkcert.sh

If this has been or will be accomplished by other means,
use the following paths for the files:
/etc/ssl/dovecotcert.pem
/etc/ssl/private/dovecot.pem

If you wish to have Dovecot started automatically at boot time,
simply add the follow lines to /etc/rc.local:

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/dovecot ]; then
	echo -n ' dovecot';       ${PREFIX}/sbin/dovecot
fi
