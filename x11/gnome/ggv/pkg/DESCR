GGv is the Gnome Postscript and PDF viewer program.  The name comes from
GhostView, a non-gnome GNU postscript viewer application on which GGv is
based.

GGv is a frontend for GhostScript, an interpreter of PostScript that is
able to properly render PostScript documents in a display or a printer.
GGv serves as a layer that isolates the user from the cumbersome options
and interface of GhostScript, and, at the same time, gives extra
features such as panning and persistent user settings.
