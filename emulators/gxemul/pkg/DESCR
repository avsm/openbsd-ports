gxemul is a machine emulator. The main goal is to
emulate MIPS-like CPUs and enough surrounding hardware to
fake real machines, capable of running real (unmodified)
operating systems (such as NetBSD, Linux, FreeBSD,
or OpenBSD), and to assist in experimenting with MIPS in general.

In addition to emulating MIPS-like CPUs an experimental
support for other CPU types (like PPC or HPPA) also exists.
