RFC 2822 defines the Date: header. It declares the header a required
part of an email message. The syntax for date headers is clearly laid
out. Stil, even a perfectly planned world has storms. The truth is,
many programs get it wrong. Very wrong. Or, they don't include a Date:
header at all. This often forces you to look elsewhere for the date,
and hoping to find something.
