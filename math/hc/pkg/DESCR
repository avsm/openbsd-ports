hc (the Hacker's calculator) is a simple yacc-based integer arithmetic
calculator designed for doing quick-and-dirty bitwise calculations. It
supports most common integer arithmetic operations, and operates in hex,
octal, or decimal modes.

This program most resembles a multi-radix version of hoc(1)
(ports/math/hoc).
