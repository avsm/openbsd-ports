-echo The configuration script has finished. You should look through and make any
-echo necessary changes to the file \"$srcdir/include/config.h\". 
-echo When you are satisfied with your configuration settings, type \"make\" to compile
-echo $_VERSION_.  When make finishes, you can type \"make install\" to install $_VERSION_
-echo globally \(if you\'re root\), or else you can type \"make install_local\" to 
-echo install $_VERSION_ to your home directory.

-echo We are trying to get statistics on the number of BitchX users. In the source
-echo directory is the file \"cl.c\". This file contains a function that will send a
-echo single UDP packet to BitchX.com. The ONLY information that packet contains is
-echo the user\'s $_VERSION_ version and OS. This function  does NOT interfere with the
-echo client in any way, and does NOT receive any information back. 
-echo 
-echo We are interested in this information for statistical purposes and to improve
-echo support for various operating systems. YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO  CONTRIBUTE TO 
-echo THIS EFFORT. If you would like to disable this function, remove the line 
-echo \"#define WANT_NOTIFY_BITCHX_COM ON\" from the file \"$srcdir/include/config.h\".
