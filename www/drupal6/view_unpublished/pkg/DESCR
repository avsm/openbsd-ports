This module allows you to grant access for specific user roles to view
unpublished nodes of a specific type. Access control is quite granular
in this regard. Additionally, using this module does not require any
modifications to your existing URL structure.
Used in concert with the Override Node Options module, you can give
specific roles the ability to publish/unpublish certain node types
without giving those roles administrative access to all nodes.
