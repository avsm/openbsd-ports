Testing is usually the ugly part of Perl module authoring. Perl gives
you a standard way to run tests with Test::Harness, and basic testing
primitives with Test::More. After that you are pretty much on your own
to develop a testing framework and philosophy. Test::More encourages you
to make your own framework by subclassing Test::Builder, but that is not
trivial.

Test::Base gives you a way to write your own test framework base class
that *is* trivial. In fact it is as simple as two lines:

    package MyTestFramework;
    use Test::Base -Base;

A module called "MyTestFramework.pm" containing those two lines, will
give all the power of Test::More and all the power of Test::Base to
every test file that uses it. As you build up the capabilities of
"MyTestFramework", your tests will have all of that power as well.
