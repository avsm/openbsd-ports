Fluxbox is yet another window manager for X. It's based on the
original Blackbox 0.61.1 code. Fluxbox looks like Blackbox and
handles styles, colors, window placement and similar thing exactly
like Blackbox (100% theme/style compability).

So what's the difference between Fluxbox and Blackbox then? The
answer is: LOTS!
