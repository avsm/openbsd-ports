APG (Automated Password Generator) is the tool set for random
password generation. It features: a built-in ANSI X9.17 RNG (Random
Number Generator)(CAST/SHA1), two methods for password generation:
FIPS 181 and truly random, configurable lengths and numbers of
passwords. Two components are supported, a network daemon (apgd)
and a command line client (apg). The command line tool does not
require the network daemon.
