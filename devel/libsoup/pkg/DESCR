Soup is a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) implementation in C.

It provides an queued asynchronous callback-based mechanism for sending
and servicing SOAP requests, and a WSDL (Web Service Definition
Language) to C compiler which generates client stubs and server
skeletons for easily calling and implementing SOAP methods.
