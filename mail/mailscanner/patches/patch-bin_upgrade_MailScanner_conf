 the default new conf file and the conf file you just created, so that you
 find any parameters whose default values have changed.
 If you ran this with a command like this
-  upgrade_$filescore $filedot $filedot.rpmnew > $filenew
+%PREFIX%/bin/upgrade_MailScanner_conf %SYSCONFDIR%/MailScanner/MailScanner.conf \\
+%PREFIX%/share/examples/MailScanner/MailScanner.conf > MailScanner.new

 then you should do
-  diff -w $filedot.rpmnew $filenew
+  diff -w $filedot $filenew
 and check for any differences in values you have not changed yourself.
