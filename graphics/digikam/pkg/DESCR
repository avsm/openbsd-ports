Digikam is an easy to use and powerful digital photo management
application, that makes importing, organizing and manipulating
digital photos a "snap".  An easy to use interface is provided
to connect to your digital camera, preview the images and download
and/or delete them.

Digikam's built-in image editor makes the common photo correction
a simple task.  The image editor is extensible via plugins:
the digikamimageplugins package contains many useful image editor
plugins.

Digikam can also make use of the KIPI image handling plugins to
extend its capabilities even further.  The kipi-plugins package 
contains many useful extensions.
