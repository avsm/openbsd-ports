This is the README for cidr, a program to calculate CIDR network and broadcast
addresses for a given IP and mask.  I wrote this primarily to aid myself
in reconfiguring my home LAN, where I often change IP addresses and subnet
ranges, because I find it difficult to remember the appropriate network 
and broadcast address for a given /N subnet.  The proper addresses are
found in the subnet tables in RFC 1878. 

The program takes an IP and netmask and outputs the network address,
broadcast address, and total number of addresses for the corresponding
subnet.  The IP address can be in binary, decimal, hexadecimal, or
dotted-quad form, and the mask can be in binary, decimal, hex, dotted-quad,
or prefix.  I decided to have the program accept those forms of input
primarily as a learning tool, since I thought it would be interesting to
see how bitwise changes in an IP address affect the dotted-quad form of
that address.
