The PowerDNS daemon is a versatile nameserver which supports
a large number of backends. These backends can either be plain
zonefiles or be more dynamic in nature. Additionally, through
use of clever programming techniques, PowerDNS offers very high
domain resolution performance.

Prime examples of backends include relational databases,
but also (geographical) loadbalancing and failover algorithms.
