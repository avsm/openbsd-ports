SWI-Prolog started life in 1986 as a Prolog in the Edinburgh tradition.
Its development has been guided from the very beginning by the desire to
build large scale applications in Prolog. For this reason it stresses
connectivity to the C-language, few system limits, comprehensive memory
management, modules, multi-threading, coroutining, constraints and a
fast and interactive development environment. Portable libraries for
graphics, databases, networking, web-services, XML, RDF and many more
complete the system.

SWI-Prolog is compliant to part one of ISO standard Prolog. In addition
it provides functionality compatible to Quintus, SICStus, LPA, Ciao and
many more.
