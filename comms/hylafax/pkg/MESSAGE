Hylafax was installed.  You'll need manual configurations to actually
activate it.

Setting up: (for impatients)
	Invoke /usr/local/sbin/faxsetup, and answer what she asks.
	When you are asked to specify the name of tty device, use a
	tty device existing on your architecture instead of "ttyd1".
	Otherwise it does not work well.

	Consult /usr/local/etc/rc.d/hylafax.sh.sample for startups.

	For accepting incoming FAX/data calls, modify /etc/ttys to
	something like below and send SIGHUP to init process:

>cua00	"/usr/local/sbin/faxgetty"	dialup	on secure
