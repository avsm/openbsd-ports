Kinput2 is an input server for X11 applications that want
Japanese text input.

A client that wants kana-kanji conversion service for Japanese
text sends a request to kinput2.  Kinput2 receives the request,
does kana-kanji conversion, and sends the converted text back
to the client.

Depending on the package, kinput may be able to use Wnn jserver,
Canna server (see Canna documents for more info), or both.

With Wnn, you may request Egg binding by using
kinput2 -ccdef ccdef.kinput2.egg
