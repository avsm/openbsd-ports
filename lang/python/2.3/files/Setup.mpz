# The mpz module interfaces to the GNU Multiple Precision library.
# You need to ftp the GNU MP library.  
# The GMP variable must point to the GMP source directory.
# This was originally written and tested against GMP 1.2 and 1.3.2.
# It has been modified by Rob Hooft to work with 2.0.2 as well, but I
# haven't tested it recently.

# A compatible MP library unencombered by the GPL also exists.  It was
# posted to comp.sources.misc in volume 40 and is widely available from
# FTP archive sites. One URL for it is:
# ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/.b/usenet/comp.sources.misc/volume40/fgmp/part01.Z
