p5-SVG allows the creation of full-fledged SVG images from perl.  All
SVG tags are supported, and any new arbitrary element tag can be added
by simply declaring it.

SVG is 100% Perl code that can generate a nested data structure
containing the DOM representation of an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
image. Using SVG, you can generate SVG objects, embed other SVG
instances into it, access the DOM object, create and access javascript,
and generate SMIL animation content.
