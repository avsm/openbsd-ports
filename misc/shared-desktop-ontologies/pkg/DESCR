woah dude. Like, here's some text.

(okay, in reality, this is just stuff kde4 really wants otherwise some
stuff won't build)

The vision of the Social Semantic Desktop defines a user's personal
information environment as a source and end-point of the Semantic
Web: Knowledge workers comprehensively express their information
and data with respect to their own conceptualizations. Semantic Web
languages and protocols are used to formalize these conceptualizations
and for coordinating local and global information access. The
Resource Description Framework RDF serves as a common data
representation format. We identified several additional requirements
for high-level knowledge representation on the social semantic
desktop. With a particular focus on addressing certain limitations
of RDF, we engineered a novel representational language akin to RDF
and the Web Ontology Language OWL, plus a number of other high-level
ontologies. Together, they provide a means to build the semantic
bridges necessary for data exchange and application integration on
distributed social semantic desktops. Although initially designed
to fulfill requirements for the NEPOMUK project, these ontologies
are useful for the semantic web community in general.
