To enable a decent configuration of drupal, please create a symbolic
link from ${PREFIX}/conf/modules.sample/drupal6.conf
to ${PREFIX}/conf/modules/drupal6.conf

ln -s ${PREFIX}/conf/modules.sample/drupal6.conf \
	${PREFIX}/conf/modules

In order to run with standard OpenBSD chroot'ed httpd:

- make sure you can connect to your database.

Create a directory for the mysql socket.

	mkdir -p /var/www/var/run/mysql

Adjust ${SYSCONFDIR}/my.cnf to put the mysql socket into the chroot.

	[client]
	socket = /var/www/var/run/mysql/mysql.sock

	[mysqld]
	socket = /var/www/var/run/mysql/mysql.sock

Don't forget to set the character set to utf8 in your database.

In mysql, assuming you're connected as admin initially.

create user drupal@localhost identified by 'password';
create database drupal character set utf8;
grant all on drupal.* to drupal@localhost;

In postgresql, assuming an `admin' account has all rights:

createuser -U admin --pwprompt --no-superuser --createdb --no-createrole drupal
createdb -U drupal -E UTF8 drupal

Updating from a drupal5 installation:

a lot of things now work. Major stumbling blocks:
* views are lost. Recreating them may be quick, or very painful if you
have a lot of them.
* usernodes no longer exist.
* image has been replaced by imagefield.

- first back-up your installation, using backup and migrate
- then DISABLE all 3rd party modules
- put the drupal5 site offline
- make sure you have enough space (database, website...)
- install the drupal6 packages you need.
- cp the defaults.settings.php to the settings.php, edit it to point to
your existing database. You will often also need $update_free_access=TRUE
- point your browser to update.php
- assuming things work, go to the /admin page, enable the modules you need
- rerun update.php
- you will often need to reconstruct the permissions
- don't forget to reset $update_free_access=FALSE
