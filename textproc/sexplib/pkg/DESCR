This library contains functionality for parsing and pretty-printing
S-expressions. In addition to that it contains a preprocessing
module for Camlp4, which can be used to automatically generate code
from type definitions for efficiently converting OCaml-values to
S-expressions and vice versa. In combination with the parsing and
pretty-printing functionality this frees users from having to write
their own I/O-routines for datastructures they define.

Possible errors during automatic conversions from S-expressions to
OCaml-values are reported in human-readable ways with exact location
information. Another module in this library allows you to extract
and replace sub-expressions in S-expressions.
