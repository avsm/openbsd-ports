FunSqueak is a squeak image that's not meant to be used for serious
development, but rather as an exploration tool.

It doesn't work 100%, but it contains lots of classical squeak packages,
to give you an idea of what is possible.

If the fonts look weird, middle click -> appearance -> window title font,
then force a redraw.
