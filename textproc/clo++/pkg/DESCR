clo++ is a command line option parser generator for C++.  It generates a
C++ header file with a class that can parse your command line and
supports just about anything that you want to do with your command line.
It also generates usage information and can handle subcommands that take
their own options. clo++ is itself written in C++ and uses a command
line option parser that it generated.
