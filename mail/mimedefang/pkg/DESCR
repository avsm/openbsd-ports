MIMEDefang is a framework for filtering e-mail. It uses Sendmail's
"Milter" API, some C glue code, and some Perl code to let you write
high-performance mail filters in Perl.

People use MIMEDefang to:
- Block viruses
- Block or tag spam
- Remove HTML mail parts
- Add boilerplate disclaimers to outgoing mail
- Remove or alter attachments
- Replace attachments with URL's
- Implement sophisticated access controls.

You're limited only by your imagination. If you can think of it and code
it in Perl, you can do it with MIMEDefang.
