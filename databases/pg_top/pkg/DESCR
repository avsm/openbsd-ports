pg_top is 'top' for PostgreSQL.  It is derived from Unix Top.  Similar
to top, pg_top allows you to monitor PostgreSQL processes.  It also
allows you to:

    * View currently running SQL statement of a process.
    * View query plan of a currently running SELECT statement.
    * View locks held by a process.
    * View user table statistics.
    * View user index statistics
