XCept provides a decoder for the CEPT protocol as it is in use for
example by the Btx service of the Deutsche Telekom.  In particular,
electronic banking and other commercial services are being handled
this way.  The CEPT protocol itself is supposed to be a European Telco
protocol, though I don't know whether any other Telco is actually
using it.

The program consists of two parts, ceptd acting as a server on the
host with the modem to use, and xcept as the client which interacts
with the user, using an X11 frontend if desired.  Xcept also provides
basic scripting facilities.

The package has been developed by Arno Augustin and Frank Hoering at
the University of Nürnberg-Erlangen, Germany.  XCept version 2 has
been the last version distributed under a BSD-style copyright; the
package went commercial in later versions.  The authors no longer
distribute or support version 2.

After installing the package, you must add

xcept		20005/tcp #XCEPT

to /etc/services, and

xcept	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/local/libexec/ceptd ceptd

to /etc/inetd.conf on your server host.
