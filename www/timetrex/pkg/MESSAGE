TimeTrex has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
 # ln -s ../timetrex /var/www/htdocs/timetrex
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

To complete the installation or update, make sure you read
  ${INSTDIR}/README.OpenBSD.
