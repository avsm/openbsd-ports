xfce4-fsguard monitors a chosen mountpoint for free disk space.  It
displays 4 different icons (red, yellow, green, unknown) and a message
box, depending on the free space.  The amount of free disk space is
visible in a tooltip.  If you left-click on its icon, it opens the
mountpoint directory in the file manager.
