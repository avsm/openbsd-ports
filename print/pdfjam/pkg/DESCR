PDFjam is a small collection of shell scripts which provide a simple
interface to some of the functionality of the excellent pdfpages
package for pdfLaTeX.

At present the utilities available are:
- pdfnup:
	allows PDF files to be "n-upped" in roughly the way that psnup
	does for PostScript files.
- pdfjoin:
	concatenates the pages of multiple PDF files together into a
	single file
- pdf90:
	rotates the pages of one or more PDF files through 90 degrees

In every case, source files are left unchanged.

A potential drawback of these utilities is that any hyperlinks in the
source PDF are lost.  On the positive side, there is no appreciable
degradation of image quality in processing PDF files with these
programs.
