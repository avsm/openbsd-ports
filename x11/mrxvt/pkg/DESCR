Mrxvt (previously named materm) is a lightweight, powerful multi-tabbed
terminal emulator for the X window system.
mrxvt is based on rxvt version 2.7.11 CVS and aterm.
It implements many useful features seen in some modern X terminal
emulators (like gnome-terminal and konsole) but aims to be fast,
lightweight and independent of standard toolkits or desktop environments
(e.g. Gnome / KDE).
