Java (TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition
Version 1.5.0

The Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment contains the Java virtual machine,
runtime class libraries, and Java application launcher that are
necessary to run programs written in the Java programming language.
It is not a development environment and does not contain development
tools such as compilers and debuggers.  For development tools, use
the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition. 

Flavors:
  native_bootstrap
    Bootstrap the jdk using a previously built and installed
    devel/jdk/1.5 package. NOTE: if this flavor is used without a
    previously installed devel/jdk/1.5 package, the port will
    just build the jdk with default (kaffe) bootstrap and stop.

  no_web
    The Mozilla plugin and Java Web Start (javaws) are not built.
    NOTE: The plugin is not working on amd64.

  with_ipv6
    Build the jdk/jre with ipv6 support. When the jdk/jre is built
    with this flavor, java will create only ipv6 sockets by default.
    Since ipv4 to ipv6 address mapping is disabled on OpenBSD,
    using ipv4 addresses will fail. Consequently, you may only
    use ipv6 addresses or you can start java with
    -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true and can only use ipv4
    addresses.
