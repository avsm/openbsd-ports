OpenTTD is modeled after the original Transport Tycoon game by Chris
Sawyer and enhances the game experience dramatically. Many features were
inspired by TTDPatch while others are original.

OpenTTD requires the original version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe data
files in order to function.  Data files and music files should be placed
in ${PREFIX}/share/openttd/data and ${PREFIX}/share/openttd/gm
respectively.
