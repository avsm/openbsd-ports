This module is a simple interface to the Gnome project's libghttp.

It allows you to make very simple HTTP requests, without the weight
of something like LWP. This makes it very useful in situations where
memory and speed are at a premium, such as mod_perl.  It has full
support for proxy requests and authenticated requests.

There is also a command line script, g-request, which is similar
in operation to LWP's lwp-request. Run it without any parameters
to get usage information.
