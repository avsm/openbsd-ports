scanlogd requires a seperate user and group named 'scanlogd' to run.  You
will need to create these manually.

Add a group:

   groupadd scanlogd

then find its gid:

   grep scanlogd /etc/group | cut -f3 -d':'

Now list all the uids to find the highest in use:

   cut -f3 -d':' /etc/passwd

add 1, and add the user with that uid and the gid added above:

  chpass -l -a "scanlogd:*:$uid:$gid:::::/nonexistent:/sbin/nologin"

The scanlogd program will automatically switch to this user upon startup.
