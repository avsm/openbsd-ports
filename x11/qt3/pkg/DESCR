Qt is a toolkit for building a GUI for X in C++. 
There are some user documentation files in ${QT_DOC}, but
the main documentation is in the qt3-html package, 
or on the web (${HOMEPAGE}).

There is also a qt3-examples package, that contains a tutorial and 
simple example programs (source + binaries).

On most architectures, you can find database plugins: qt3-mysql and
qt3-postgresql.

People who want to use qt3 to compile applications outside the ports tree
should note that qt3's installation conforms to OpenBSD habits, not
TrollTech's recommendations.
Accordingly:
- libs are separated from includes.
- moc is installed as ${PREFIX}/bin/moc3, in order not to conflict with
  other qt versions.
- uic is installed as ${PREFIX}/bin/uic3

Generally, it's just a question of invoking 

env MOC=moc3 UIC=uic3 configure --with-qt-includes=${PREFIX}/include/X11/qt3 
	--with-qt-libraries=${PREFIX}/lib/qt3

Or to force MOC/UIC in your make/gmake invocation:
make MOC=moc3 UIC=uic3
will override the Makefile contents.

Warning: the qt3 library also appears under ${PREFIX}/lib, but you
*must* make sure your application sees ${PREFIX}/lib/qt3 *first*, because
${PREFIX}/lib may also contain a later incarnation of qt, in which case 
the linker will pick up the most recent library.

The qt packages currently do not include mt versions of qt, because of
insufficient testing.
