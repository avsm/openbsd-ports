Bombermaze is Bomberman clone for GNOME. It is a multiplayer action game
in which players run around in a square-grid maze while dropping bombs
and collecting power-ups. The bombs explode after a short time delay,
taking out any nearby bricks and players. For maximum effect, bombs
can be arranged so as to cause a chain reaction of explosions.
The last player left is the winner.
