To configure a Trac environment, you must run the following command
and follow the prompts:
    trac-admin </path/to/projectenv> initenv

Here, "</path/to/projectenv>" is the location on your disk where you
want to place the project environment.

"</path/to/projectenv/conf/trac.ini>" is the configuration file of your
project environment which allows to setup the name of the project, the
location of the enscript binary, etc.

To get started with Trac, you can use the built-in webserver, by running:
   tracd -p 8085 </path/to/projectenv>

Now you can open up a web brower and go to http://localhost:8085/. You
should see a single link for the project you just created. If you follow
the link, you should see trac in action.

You can find the Trac Installation Guide here:
  http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/TracInstall

If updating from trac-0.10.4p1 or older, you must update trac's 
database from sqlite2 to sqlite3. You do this by going to the 
db-directory of trac and running the following commands:

mv trac.db trac.db.old
${LOCALBASE}/bin/sqlite trac.db.old .dump | ${LOCALBASE}/bin/sqlite3 trac.db
