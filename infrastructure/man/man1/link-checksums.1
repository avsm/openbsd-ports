.Sh NAME
.Nm link-checksums
.Nd creates by-cipher links for distfiles
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm link-checksums
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a helper script for use within
.Pa /usr/ports/distfiles
for people running distfiles mirrors.
.Pp
.Nm
will create hardlinks between distfiles and corresponding checksums;
those will in turn be used by the ports infrastructure, when running
.Sq make fetch REFETCH=true .
.Pp
.Nm
scans directory
.Ev DISTDIR
.Po
by default,
.Pa /usr/ports/distfiles
.Pc
and creates hardlinks for each checksum algorithm in
.Ev CIPHERS
(by default, sha1 md5 rmd160 sha256),
such as
.Pa by_cipher/md5/8506fd205028a96c741e4037de6e3c42 .
.Pp
If
.Ev CIPHER_CACHE
is defined, it points to an
.Nm sqlite3
database
that records timestamps from already checksummed files.
In which case,
.Nm
is dependent on
the packages
.Nm sqlite3 ,
.Nm p5-DBI ,
and
.Nm p5-DBD-SQLite
being installed.
