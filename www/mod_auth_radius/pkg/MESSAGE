To finish the install of mod_auth_radius, you need
to enable the module using the following command

  ${PREFIX}/sbin/${MODAPACHE_ENABLE}

Also, copy the following file into your Apache config:
${PREFIX}/share/examples/mod_auth_radius/httpd.conf-example

If you already have Apache running on your machine,
you should not use "apachectl restart" - instead,
you should fully stop and then restart the server.
