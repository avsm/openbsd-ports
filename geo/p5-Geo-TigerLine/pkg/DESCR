Geo::TigerLine is a module around the TIGER/Line geographic data
generated by the U.S. Census.  TIGER/Line data files contain detailed
information about roads, waterways, political and property boundaries,
street addresses, etc.  Almost (but not quite) everything you need to
recreate something like Mapquest.

Geo::TigerLine has been updated to reflect the structure of the 2003
TIGER/Line data sets.  If you want to use older datasets, consider
regenerating the TIGER/Line data set parsers with the mk_parsers script
distributed with this module.
