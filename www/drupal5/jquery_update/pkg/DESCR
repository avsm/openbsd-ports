This module facilitates the upgrade of JQuery. JQuery 1.0.1 is
included with Drupal 5, however it is not very well supported in the JQuery
community. In order to use most current and advanced JQuery functionality
you will want to build off a newer version of JQuery. This module includes
John Resig's compat-1.0.js plugin that provides backwards compatiblity for
newer versions of JQuery to work with the JS code in Drupal 5.
