Kronolith is the Horde calendar application. It provides a stable
and featureful individual calendar system for every Horde user, and
collaboration/scheduling features are starting to take shape. It
makes extensive use of the Horde Framework to provide integration
with other applications.

Right now, Kronolith implements a solid, stand-alone calendar system,
allowing repeating events, all-day events, custom fields, keywords,
and managing multiple users through Horde Authentication. The
calendar API that Kronolith uses is abstracted such that it could
work with any backend, but right now we provide SQL (abstracted to
support most databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and
MSSQL via PEAR DB) and MCAL backend libraries.
