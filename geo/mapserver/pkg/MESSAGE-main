If you plan to use mapserv CGI with a  chrooted httpd, make sure to
copy the libs needed by mapserv binary from ${LOCALBASE}/lib, but also
the projection definitions from libgeotiff and proj packages to the
chroot:

# mkdir -p ${PREFIX-main}${LOCALBASE}/share/{epsg_csv,proj}
# cp ${LOCALBASE}/share/epsg_csv/* ${PREFIX-main}${LOCALBASE}/share/epsg_csv
# cp ${LOCALBASE}/share/proj/* ${PREFIX-main}${LOCALBASE}/share/proj
