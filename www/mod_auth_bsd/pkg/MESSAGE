+---------------
| To finish the install of mod_auth_bsd, you need
| to enable the module using the following command:
|
| # ${PREFIX}/sbin/mod_auth_bsd-enable
|
| If you already have Apache running on your machine,
| you should not use "apachectl restart" - instead,
| you should fully stop and then restart the server.
