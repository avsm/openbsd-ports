The Glasgow Haskell Compiler is a state-of-the-art, open source, compiler and
interactive environment for the functional language Haskell. Highlights:

   * GHC supports the entire Haskell 98 language plus a wide variety of
     extensions.
   * GHC works on several platforms including Windows and most varieties of
     Unix, and several different processor architectures. There are detailed
     instructions for porting GHC to a new platform.                         
   * GHC has extensive optimisation capabilities, including inter-module     
     optimisation.                   
   * GHC compiles Haskell code either by using an intermediate C compiler 
     (GCC), or by generating native code on some platforms. The interactive
     environment compiles Haskell to bytecode, and supports execution of
     mixed bytecode/compiled programs.
   * Profiling is supported, both by time/allocation and various kinds of
     heap profiling.                                                         
   * GHC comes with a wide range of libraries.

The following flavors are available:

- native_bootstrap (PSEUDO_FLAVOR):
        Use an already installed ghc for bootstrapping (default is
        to boot from .hc files). If there's no preinstalled GHC, this
	may lead to GHC being built twice!
