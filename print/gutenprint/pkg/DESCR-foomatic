Gutenprint, formerly known as gimp-print, is a project to provide high
quality drivers for Canon, Epson, Lexmark and PCL printers.
This package contains gutenprint driver information for creating PPD
files with the foomatic-db-engine package. The PPD files can be used
with foomatic-rip and/or CUPS print filters.

The 'gutenprint' CUPS driver is not provided on OpenBSD but instead the
gutenprint-ijs.${MAJOR_V} which is spooler independent (uses foomatic).
