"The Mother Of All Games" on which it is based. Scorched 3D incorporates
a lively three dimensional landscape that includes animated jets, naval
vessels, water, and even birds, in addition to detailed tanks and
projectiles. Other enhancements include LAN and internet play and music.
Scorched 3D is totally free to play and is available for both Microsoft
