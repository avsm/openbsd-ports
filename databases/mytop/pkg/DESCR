mytop is a console-based (non-gui) tool for monitoring the threads and
overall performance of MySQL 3.22.x, 3.23.x, and 4.x servers. It runs on
most Unix systems (including Mac OS X) which have Perl, DBI, and
Term::ReadKey installed.  And with Term::ANSIColor installed you even
get color. If you install Time::HiRes, you'll get good real-time
queries/second stats.
