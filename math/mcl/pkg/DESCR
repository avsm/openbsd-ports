The Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL) is a fast and scalable
cluster algorithm for graphs based on simulation of (stochastic)
flow in graphs.  The algorithm was developed by Stijn van Dongen
at the Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science in the
Netherlands.

The MCL algorithm is very fast, very scalable, and has a number
of attractive properties causing it to deliver high-quality
clusterings.
