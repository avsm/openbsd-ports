 XKOBO is a game for X. The play is quite simple. Your object is to
 destroy all the fortresses. You can control your ship by pressing
 the cursor keys, and shot beams by pressing the SHIFT key or the 
 left mouse button.

 XKOBO requires:
 
   1) Unix (BSD, Linux, etc.)
   2) X window system (256 colors or greater)
   3) C++ compiler

 This program has been tested on the following systems:

   *  Linux           + gcc
   *  Sun-OS (4.1.4)  + gcc
   *  BSD/OS          + gcc

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

* INSTALLING

 Edit Imakefile and type

     % xmkmf -a
     % make
     % su
     # make install
     # make install.man

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

* PLAYING

 You can control your ship by pressing the cursor keys, and shot beams
 by pressing the SHIFT key or the left mouse button. The game can be 
 paused by pressing 's'. Pressing 'q' will cause xkobo to quit the game.

* OPTIONS

    -doublesize    The window of xkobo is enlarged. But memory usage
                   is also enlarged.

    -memory        It causes xkobo to reduce memory usage, but slow
                   down (a little). 

    -fit           Use the default colormap. Normally xkobo uses a
                   private colormap.
