Zile is a small Emacs clone. Zile is a customizable, self-documenting
real-time open-source display editor. Zile was written to be as
similar as possible to Emacs; every Emacs user should feel at home.

Zile features:
    * Small. It is very useful for small footprint installations (like
      on floppy disk) or quick editing sessions.
    * 8-bit clean. Zile can operate with binary files.
    * Looks like Emacs. Most Zile key sequences and function names are
      identical to Emacs ones.
    * Multi buffer editing with multi level undo. The number of files
      and undo operations that Zile can handle is limited only by memory.
    * Multi window. Zile can display multiple windows on the screen.
    * Killing, yanking and registers. The standard killing, yanking and
      register features of Emacs are available under Zile.
    * Minibuffer completion. Zile can complete commands and filenames
      in the minibuffer.
    * Auto fill (word wrap). Zile automatically breaks the lines when
      they become too wide (if the Auto Fill Mode is enabled).
