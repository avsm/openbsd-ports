gtk input module for uim, the universal input method.

In order to use it, you have to put something like

export XMODIFIERS=@im=uim
export GTK_IM_MODULE="uim"

in your .xinitrc.

Under gtk+,
uim-pref-gtk can be used to set up basic preferences.
uim-toolbar-gtk should be run along the application in
order to be able to enter japanese text.

uim is using the utf8 encoding internally, so this
should be used in various applications (e.g.,
set encoding=utf8 in gvim).
