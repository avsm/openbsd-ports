Using foo2zjs under OpenBSD
===========================

Before using foo2zjs you should get extra files from the web, such as
.ICM profiles (for color correction) and firmware using the command
    ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/doc/foo2zjs/getweb

Then copy the downloaded file(s) into the corresponding directory under
    ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/foo2*

If your printer require a firmware load, run the following command as
root each time the device is powered up:
    cat ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/foo2zjs/firmware/XXX.dl > /dev/ugenN.EE
(where XXX is your printer firmware name)
You can use a hotplugd(8) attach script to make it automatic.
