Action Views is used together with the views module. Action views
adds a view type of "Action View" to the views interface. This will
present your view as a table, and adds a list of actions you can
perform against the results of the query executed by the view. We
have taken a modular approach whereby additional actions can easily
be added to the module in the form of an include file.

The typical kind of usage for this module is to execute actions
against multiple records, so for example, deleting a bunch of nodes
in one go; changing taxonomies for a bunch of stories in one go,
etc.

Don't forget to review supplementary actions available in the roles pages.
