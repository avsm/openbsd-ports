This module includes libraries that are central to the development and
execution of a KDE-PIM application.

The KDE-PIM project aims to bring together those who wish to help design,
implement, test, etc. anything that's to do with personal information
management.

The kdepimlibs module exists to:

1. restrain the size of the kdepim module
2. co-locate code in kdelibs which is closely associated to kdepim
  (i.e.,kresources and kabc).  That this code is in kdelibs, but
  other similar code like libkcal is not, can only be understood by
  historical  reasons.
3. provide access to the PIM libraries for code from other modules.

In summary, kdepimlibs is a controlled extension and modularization of
kdelibs to the PIM space.

Currently, kdepimlibs includes:

* kcal: C++ API for the iCalendar and vCalendar formats
* kcal/libical: a basic iCalendar protocol implementation, see RFCs 2245,2246
* kldap: C++ API for LDAP access
* kmime: C++ API for MIME handling
* ktnef: C++ API for the handling of TNEF data
* kxmlrpclient: An XML-RPC client library
* syndication: An RSS/Atom feed parser library
