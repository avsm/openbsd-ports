Jad is a Java decompiler, i.e. program that reads one or more Java class files 
and converts them into Java source files which can be compiled again. 

Jad is a 100% pure C++ program and it generally works several times faster than 
decompilers written in Java. Jad doesn't use the Java runtime for its 
functioning, therefore no special setup is required (like changes to the 
CLASSPATH variable).
