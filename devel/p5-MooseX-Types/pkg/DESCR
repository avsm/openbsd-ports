Organise your Moose types in libraries.  The types provided with Moose
are by design global. This package helps you to organise and selectively
import your own and the built-in types in libraries. As a nice side
effect, it catches typos at compile-time too.  However, the main reason
for this module is to provide an easy way to not have conflicts with
your type names, since the internal fully qualified names of the types
will be prefixed with the library's name.
