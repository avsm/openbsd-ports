DansGuardian is an award winning Open Source web content filter which
currently runs on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Mac OS X, HP-UX, and
Solaris. It filters the actual content of pages based on many methods
including phrase matching, PICS filtering and URL filtering. It does not
purely filter based on a banned list of sites like lesser totally
commercial filters.

DansGuardian is designed to be completely flexible and allows you to
tailor the filtering to your exact needs. It can be as draconian or as
unobstructive as you want. The default settings are geared towards what
a primary school might want but DansGuardian puts you in control of what
you want to block.
