This module removes unnecessary whitespace from JavaScript code.  The
primary requirement developing this module is to not break working code:
if working JavaScript is in input then working JavaScript is output.  It
is ok if the input has missing semi-colons, snips like '++ +' or '12
.toString()', for example.
