MuPDF is a lightweight PDF and XPS viewer.

The renderer in MuPDF is tailored for high quality anti-aliased
graphics. It renders text with metrics and spacing accurate to within
fractions of a pixel for the highest fidelity in reproducing the look of
a printed page on screen.

MuPDF is also small, fast, and yet complete. It supports PDF 1.7 with
transparency, encryption, hyperlinks, annotations, searching and more.
It also reads OpenXPS documents.

We don't support interactive features such as form filling, javascript
and transitions. MuPDF is written modularly, so such features can be
added on by integrators if they so desire.

Command line utilities include:  pdfdraw, to render pages and output
PNM image files.  pdfshow, to print and examine the objects in a PDF file.
pdfclean, to decompress and pretty-print the streams and objects in PDF
files and also to extract individual pages.  pdfinfo_mupdf, to display
information about objects.  pdfextract, to extract individual objects.
