    * Precession
    * Proper Motion
    * Sidereal Time
    * Solar Coordinates (using VSOP87)
    * Coordinate Transformations
    * Planetary Positions Mercury - Pluto (Mercury - Neptune using VSOP87)
    * Planetary Magnitude, illuminated disk and phase angle.
    * Lunar Position (using ELP82), phase angle.
    * Elliptic Motion of bodies (Asteroid + Comet positional and orbit data)
    * Asteroid + Comet magnitudes
    * Parabolic Motion of bodies (Comet positional data)
    * Orbit velocities and lengths
    * Atmospheric refraction
    * Rise, Set and Transit times.
    * Semidiameters of the Sun, Moon, Planets and asteroids.
    * Angular separation of bodies
