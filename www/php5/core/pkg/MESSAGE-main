To enable the php5 module please create a symbolic
link from ${PHP_CONFIG_PATH}/modules.sample/php5.conf
to ${PHP_CONFIG_PATH}/modules/php5.conf.

ln -s ${PHP_CONFIG_PATH}/modules.sample/php.conf \
	${PHP_CONFIG_PATH}/modules

The recommended php configuration has been installed
to ${PHP_CONFIG_PATH}/php.ini.
 
Don't forget that the default OpenBSD httpd is chrooted
into /var/www by default, so you may need to create support
directories such as /var/www/tmp for PHP to work correctly.
