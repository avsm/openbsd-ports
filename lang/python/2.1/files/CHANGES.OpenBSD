As required by item 3 of the PSF license, here is a brief summary
of changes made to this version of Python for the OpenBSD package.

1.  tempfile.py was patched to not try /usr/tmp as a possible
    tempfile directory.

2.  test_fcntl.py was patched to support OpenBSD 3.0 and above.

3.  libpython is created as a shared library, and the pthread stack
    size was doubled to support this with complex applications such
    as Zope.

4.  OpenBSD threads are used for threading support.

5.  The interpreter is called "python2.1", and pydoc "pydoc2.1" in
    order to support multiple versions of Python coexisting on the
    same system.  If no "python" binary exists, a symlink to
    "python2.1" is created when the package is installed.

These changes are available in the OpenBSD CVS repository
<http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html> in ports/lang/python.
