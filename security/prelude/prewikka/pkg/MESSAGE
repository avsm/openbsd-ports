To start with prelude-prewikka, you have to create the "prewikka"
database.

Here is the instructions for PotsgreSQL:

# su - _postgresql
$ createdb -O prelude prewikka
$ cd ${PREFIX}/share/prewikka/database/
$ psql -U prelude -W prewikka < pgsql.sql


Then, update ${SYSCONFDIR}/prewikka/prewikka.conf with your database
settings.


Eventually, start prewikka's webserver (listening by default on 8000):

# prewikka-httpd

The default user is "admin", with "admin" as password.
