These libraries are part of the Linux compatibility options
for OpenBSD.  To get Linux compat working you will need

1) A Linux binary such as doom, Wingz, or maple

2) These libraries

then run the Linux binary. 

The kernel option `COMPAT_LINUX' is necessary.

* if you add new libraries, you should run
  /emul/linux/sbin/ldconfig to update the caches.
