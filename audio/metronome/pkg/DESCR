Metronome is a very simple metronome program.
It just provides ticks on the audio output, at a given bpm.
It can also stress out one tick out of n to count 4 beats and
similar things.

It was written specifically to avoid installing huge toolchains or using
X11 just to get simple tick, tick, tick out of the console.
