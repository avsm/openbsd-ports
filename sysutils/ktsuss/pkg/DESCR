ktsuss stands for "keep the su simple, stupid", and as the name says,
is a graphical version of su written in C and GTK+ 2. The idea of the
project is to remain simple and bug free... The ktsuss binary is
installed set-uid, takes care of authentication and fiddles with
uid/gids, while re_su is the graphical user interface asking for the
desired username and password.
