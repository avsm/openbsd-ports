tla is an Arch CLI written in C.

Arch is a revision control system, i.e. a system that makes it easy to
track changes to computer files, mostly the source code to complex
software systems. 

It has the following features that set it apart from other revision 
control systems, such as CVS, Subversion or Bitkeeper:

- distributed repositories 
- advanced merging capabilities
- low barrier of entry : everybody can easily publish their changes to
  others projects. Repositories can be hosted on HTTP, FTP SFTP and
  WebDav server.
- renames handled
- archive signing and integrity checking : a facility by which the
  integrity of a publicly accessible archive can be verified.
