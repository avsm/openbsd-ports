XML-RPC is a quick-and-easy way to make procedure calls over the
Internet. It converts the procedure call into XML document, sends
it to a remote server using HTTP, and gets back the response as
XML.   Due to the complexity of XML, this invariably leads to buggy
code. XML-RPC should never be used without total trust on both sides
of the connection. XML-RPC should never be used on non-authentified
channels.

This library provides a modular implementation of XML-RPC for
C and C++.  XML-RPC For C and C++ is designed for Unix and is most
tested on unix. The authors of the software thinks it works on any
standard unix, but the code is rather sloppy and needs quite a few
patches to run correctly on OpenBSD. Do not trust it for anything
important.

This package mostly exist to facilitate running code that 
occasionally wants xmlrpc, such as cmake.
