To use native audio, pick the Sun output plugin in the XMMS preferences
window (ctrl-p).

To go easier on resources, don't use the `scope' visualization mode, and
increasing the buffer size in audio preferences significantly might help.
If all else fails, use renice(8) on XMMS. Enabling the `XMMS uses mixer
exclusively' option may be of some help on extremely slow systems.
