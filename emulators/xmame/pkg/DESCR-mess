MESS stands for Multi Emulator Super System. It is an emulator for the
hardware of many different games consoles (e.g. Sega, NES, SNES, etc.)
as well as many different old games-oriented home computers (e.g. C64,
C128, ZX80, etc.)

Packages can be built with additional FLAVORs:

  x11:  built with x11 support (default).

  gl:   built with GL support.

  sdl:  built with SDL support.
        This FLAVOR requiers the sdl package.
