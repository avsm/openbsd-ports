Using the PageCache plugin, you can cache the full output of different
pages so they are served to your visitors as fast as possible.  This
method of caching is very useful for withstanding huge amounts of
request in a short time.

This plugin requires that you also load a Cache plugin.  Please
reference the documentation for this module when choosing a cache
backend.
