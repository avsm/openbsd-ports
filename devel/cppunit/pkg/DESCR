CppUnit is a C++ unit testing framework. It started its life as a port
of JUnit to C++ done by Michael Feathers.

Features:

 - XML output with hook for additional data
 - Compiler like text output to integrate with an IDE
 - Helper macros for easier test suite declaration
 - Hierarcal test fixture support
 - Test registry to reduce recompilation need
 - Test plug-in for faster compile/test cycle
   (self testable dynamic library)
 - Protector to encapsulate test execution
   (allow capture of exception not derived from std::exception)
