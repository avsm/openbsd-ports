Program: ngrep 
Author: nocarrier <jpr5@darkridge.com>

Goal: 

  A program that mimicks as much functionality in GNU grep as
  possible, applied at the network layer.

Description:

  ngrep stands for network grep, and is a pcap-aware tool that will
  allow you to specify extended regular expressions to match against
  the data payloads of packets, and currently recognizes TCP and UDP,
  and works on ethernet, ppp and slip interfaces.  Blank regexes
  assume '.*'.

Usage:

  ngrep <-hiwq> <-d dev> [regex] <filter>

  -h  is help/usage
  -i  is ignore case
  -w  is word-regex (expression must match as a word)
  -q  is be quiet
  -d  is use a device different from the default (pcap)

  [regex]   is any extended regular expression (metachars are
            significant and don't have to be escaped)
  <filter>  is any pcap filter statement 

Examples:

  o ngrep  -qd eth1  'HTTP'  tcp port 80

    Be quiet, look only at tcp packets with either source or dest port
    80 on interface eth1, look for anything matching 'HTTP'. 

  o ngrep  '(USER|PASS)'  tcp port 21

    Look only at tcp packets with either source or dest port 21, look
    for anything resembling an FTP login.

  o ngrep  -wi  '(user|pass)'  tcp port 21
  
    Look at tcp packets with either source or dest port 21, that match
    either 'user' or 'pass' (case insensitively) as a word. 

  o ngrep  -qd le0  in-addr  port 53

    Look at all packets with either source or dest port 53 on
    interface le0, that match match 'in-addr'.  Be quiet.
