London Law is an online multiplayer adaptation of the classic Scotland
Yard board game, first published by Ravensburger in 1983. The game is
unusually asymmetric; one player controls the movements of the criminal
Mr. X as he tries to evade Scotland Yard, while another one to five
players control five detectives trying to track him down. Mr. X has an
advantage in access to transportation routes, and his precise location
remains hidden for most of the game. The detectives have only the
advantage of superior numbers, so they must work in concert to limit the
criminal's options. London Law features an attractive map overlaid on
high-resolution satellite imagery.
