keynav is a piece of an on-going experiment to make pointer-driven
interfaces easier and faster for users to operate. It lets you move the
pointer quickly to most points on the screen with only a few key
strokes.
You select a piece of the screen. The screen is initially wholely
selected. One move will cut that region by half. A move is a direction:
up, down, left, and right.
Once you're done moving, you simply indicate (with a key stroke) that
you want to move. Boom, cursor moves.
