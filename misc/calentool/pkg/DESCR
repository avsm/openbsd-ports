CALENTOOL - Version 2.3X

Calentool is a day/week/month/year-at-glance tool for Workstations
and X terminals.  The windowed display interface uses XView (2.0 or 3.0)
and X11R4 or X11R5 to present an OPEN LOOK style user interface (including
the Help key!). 

One can view a single day's appointments and notes, a weeks worth (with
abbreviated messages), a month at a time (with appointment flags) or a year
at a time (with appointment flags).  Alternate appointment files can be
specified to allow checking other users' schedules.

Recurring appointments (e.g every Monday or every 1st & 3rd Tuesday),
as well as a reminder of future appointments are available.

Interesting information about the sun and moon is also available for viewing.

See the man page for all the gory details.

Conversion programs are supplied to convert from some of the other
common calendar program appointment files to calentool's file format.
