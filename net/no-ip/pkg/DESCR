This is the No-IP.com Dynamic DNS update client.  When configured
correctly, the client will check your IP address at a given time
interval checking to see if your IP has changed.  If your IP address
has changed it will notify No-IP.coms dns servers and update the
IP corresponding to your No-IP/No-IP+ hostname.
