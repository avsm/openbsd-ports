Centericq is a text mode menu- and window-driven IM interface
that supports the ICQ2000, Yahoo!, AIM, MSN, IRC and Jabber
protocols.  It is a fully featured client, can do things like
file transfer. Has the ability to associate sounds with
different actions/events and play them through a sound card,
as well as the standard beeping.

Things like colors are not hard-coded in the program itself,
but can be set in the corresponding config files.
