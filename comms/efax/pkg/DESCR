Efax

efax is a relatively small ANSI C/POSIX program that provides the
data transport function for fax applications.  A simple shell
script (``fax'') is included in the distribution to let you
create, send, receive, view and print faxes.

efax is smaller and easier to install than HylaFax(FlexFax), NetFax, or
mgetty+sendfax.  It uses your system's own getty to handle
incoming data calls. As one user put it, ``EFAX is a nice simple
program for single user systems.''

The package now includes the ``efix'' program to convert text,
fax or PBM files into fax, PBM, PGM, HP-PCL or Postscript files.
To fax Postscript images you will need Ghostscript.  To preview
faxes you will need a PGM file viewer (e.g. xv or xloadimage).
If you don't have a PCL or Postscript printer you will need an
appropriate conversion program (e.g. pbmtoepson or Ghostscript) .
