Smbsniff is a LanManager packet sniffer that will write to your
disk all the files shared and the documents printed in a LanManager
environment (all the Microsoft and Samba machines using LanManager
protocol to share data).  
This is a proof of concept to show that LanManager (CIFS) is an 
extremely insecure protocol.
