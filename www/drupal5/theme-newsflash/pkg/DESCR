NewsFlash features 12 regions divided into fully collapsible sidebars
and horizontal sections. This means that NewsFlash automatically
sizes and places blocks depending on the blocks that you wish to
display on any page. NewsFlash can be configured for fluid or fixed
widths using the easy configuration panel. When using fluid widths,
the content and page layout automatically resize to fill the user's
screen.
