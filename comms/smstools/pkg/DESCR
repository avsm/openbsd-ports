The SMS Server Tools 3 is a SMS Gateway software which can send and
receive short messages through GSM modems and mobile phones.

You can send short messages by simply storing text files into a
special spool directory. The program monitors this directory and
sends new files automatically. It also stores received short messages
into another directory as text files. Binary messages (including
Unicode text) are also supported, for example ring tone messages.
It's also possible to send a WAP Push message to the WAP / MMS
capable mobile phone.

The program can run other external programs or scripts after events
like reception of a new message, successful sending and also when
the program detects a problem. These programs can inspect the related
text files and perform automatic actions, for example storing
information into a database, sending an automatic reply, forwarding
messages via eMail (SMS to eMail gateway), ... and whatever you like.

This software needs a GSM modem (or mobile phone) with SMS command
set according to the european specifications GSM 07.05 (=ETSI TS
300 585) and GSM 03.38 (=ETSI TS 100 900). AT command set is
supported.
