GKrellMSS is a plugin for GKrellM that has a VU meter and a chart. The
VU meter displays left and right channel audio levels. The sound scope
chart draws combined left and right audio channels as an oscilloscope
trace. The trace sweep speeds are adjustable from 100 usec/div to 50
msec/div, and there is a vertical sensitivity adjustment. And of course,
since it's a scope, it's triggered.
