xmine is an X11-based version of the popular PC game Minesweeper. The
object is to place flags on mines on the game board without exposing
them.

xmine is freely redistributable.  It's mostly Xlib-based, but it
requires Motif libraries for the menus.

This version of xmine is based on Paul Falstad's version 1.0.3, as
published in comp.sources.x. It has been heavily munged to work
without OSF/Motif.

Since the game itself has some 3D look, linking against the famous
Xaw3d library is highly recommended.
