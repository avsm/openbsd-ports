GnomeVFS is a filesystem abstraction library allowing applications
plugable transparent access to a variety of "real" filesystems, from
WebDAV to digital cameras, to the local filesystem. It also contains a
number of other convenient file utilities such as a comprehensive MIME
database / Application registry, and a copy engine.

Note that the GnomeVFS has been deprecated in favor of gio/gvfs.
