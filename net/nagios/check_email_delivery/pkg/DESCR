This package consists of three Nagios plugins.

- check_smtp_send sends an email message with custom headers and body.

- check_imap_receive uses an IMAP search to check an INBOX or folder
for messages matching certain criteria. SSL support is available.

- check_email_delivery uses the other two plugins (or you may provide
alternatives) to check full email sending/delivery loops. As well as
alerting via nagios, running statistics can be recorded to a file.
