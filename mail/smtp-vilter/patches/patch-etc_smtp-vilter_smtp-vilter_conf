+# At present only one option is available:

+# 0:	use plain headers as per previous versions

+# 1:	include a tag of the form "(Authenticated sender: user@domain)" in the
+#	Received header, if the MTA indicates that the sender successfully

+#
+# The latter setting emulates Postfix's smtpd_sasl_authenticated_header option,
