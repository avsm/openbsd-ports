Music::Audioscrobbler::Submit is a scrobbler for MPD implementing the
1.2 protocol, including "Now Playing' feature.

Items are submitted and stored in a queue. This queue is stored as a
file using Tie::File. When you submit a track, it will add the queue to
the track and process the queue. If it submits all items in the queue,
the submit() method will return true.
