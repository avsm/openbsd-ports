The program accepts a list of devices on standard input, each device
name optionally followed by a comma and a number.  The number, if
given, indicates the number of occurrences of the named device.

The output is a table of the same devices, with CSR and vector
assignments according to DEC standards.  Floating assignments are
flagged with asterisks, as in original SYSGEN output.  VMS device
names and support info are, however, not printed.
