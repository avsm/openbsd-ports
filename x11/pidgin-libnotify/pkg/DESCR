pidgin-libnotify adds a libnotify interface to pidgin, enabling
popups much like guifications.  It has some configuration options,
to show popups when a buddy signs on, on new messages and on new
conversations only.

After installation, don't forget to enable the plugin in pidgin via
the Tools->Plugins menu.
