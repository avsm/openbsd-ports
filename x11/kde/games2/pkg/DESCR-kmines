KMines is the classical Minesweeper game. You must uncover all the empty cases 
without blowing on a mine. 

When you uncover a case, a number appears : it indicates how many mines surround
this case. If there is no number the neighbour cases are automatically 
uncovered. In your process of uncovering secure cases, it is very useful to put
a flag on the cases which contain a mine.
