Gamin is a file and directory monitoring system defined to be a subset
of the FAM (File Alteration Monitor) system.
The main goals of the project are:
  * minimize the security model of FAM
  * simplify the code base
  * provide an API and ABI compatible replacement for FAM
  * try to fix some other issues like resource consumption

This package provides the gamin API and libs.
