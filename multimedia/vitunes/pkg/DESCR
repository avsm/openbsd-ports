vitunes is a curses-based music player and playlist manager for *nix 
whose goals are: 

1. a minimalistic appearance
2. strong vi-like bindings
3. quick playlist creation/management.

vitunes does not strive to be a full-blown media player, but rather 
a full-blown media indexer and playlist manager.
Additionally, vitunes never needs write-access to anything outside 
of its work directory (default is ~/.vitunes/).
It never touches/modifies anything outside of there and doesn't leave 
junk files anywhere.
