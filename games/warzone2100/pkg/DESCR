Warzone 2100 was an innovative 3D real-time strategy game back in 1999,
and most will agree it didn't enjoy the commercial success it could
have had.  The game's source code was liberated on December 6th,
2004, under a GPL license.  Soon after that, the Warzone 2100 ReDev
project was formed to take care of its future.
