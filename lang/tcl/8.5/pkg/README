The OpenBSD port of the Tcl dynamic language was designed to balance
deriving the maximum value from the original software while keeping any
modifications to a minimum. This document describes the differences and
includes a handy guide and patch for adding Tcl and Tk to /etc/man.conf.

The principal change is to the installation. In order to be able to
install multiple versions of Tcl on OpenBSD without conflict, some
deviation from the original installation is required.


Tclsh / Wish

Tclsh and wish are installed as tclsh8.5 and wish8.5, respectively.
Many Tcl programs expect to find tclsh or wish.
They will have to be modified to launch the correct shell or links
tclsh and wish may be created which point to tclsh8.5 and wish8.5,
respectively. These links may have already been created by the
system administrator. It is of course also possible to create one's
own links.


Files / Directories

Configuration files
tclConfig.sh, tkConfig.sh
normally in
${TRUEPREFIX}/lib
now in
${TRUEPREFIX}/lib/tcl8.5, ${TRUEPREFIX}/lib/tk8.5

Include files ('public' - see below)
*.h
normally in
${TRUEPREFIX}/include
now in
${TRUEPREFIX}/include/tcl8.5, ${TRUEPREFIX}/include/tk8.5

Manual pages
*.1, *.3, *.n
normally in
${TRUEPREFIX}/man
now in
${TRUEPREFIX}/lib/tcl8.5/man, ${TRUEPREFIX}/lib/tk8.5/man

Demos
*.tcl, *
normally in
${TRUEPREFIX}/lib/tk8.5/demos
now in
${TRUEPREFIX}/share/examples/tk8.5


Additional Header Files

Additional (what Tcl/Tk calls 'private') include (.h) files are installed
under ${TRUEPREFIX}/include/tcl8.5 and ${TRUEPREFIX}/include/tk8.5 in a
directory structure which mimics the Tcl and Tk source code directory
layouts.  Some software that compiles and links against Tcl or Tk
requires these 'private' headers and therefore assumes that the Tcl or Tk
source (containing the 'private' headers) is available.  This setup
enables using such 'poorly-behaved' software without requiring the
presence of the entire Tcl and Tk source trees.


Libraries

On architectures that support shared libraries, additional static
libraries (libtcl85.a, libtk85.a) are built from the -fPIC compiled
object (.o) files.  A soft link from any lib.a is created to lib_pic.a
in order to satisfy l*btool (apparently).


Manual Page Configuration

Changes to /etc/man.conf are required so that OpenBSD's man(1) and
related commands can find the Tcl and Tk manual pages.

Additional _whatdb entries are needed which point to the Tcl and Tk
whatis.db files. The Tcl and Tk manual page directories need to be added
to the _default and n sections. Additional sections tcl and tk point to
the Tcl and Tk manual page directories.

Following this text is a patch (with instructions) that will perform
the aforementioned changes on an unmodified /etc/man.conf. If not
used directly it can serve as a guide.
