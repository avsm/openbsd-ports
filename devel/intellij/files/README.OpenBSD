IntelliJ on OpenBSD
===================

1. Windowing Problems
---------------------

If the splash-screen displays but you then only see a grey main screen,
install the wmname package and run 'wmname LG3D'. This is a problem that
has been seen with some Java-based applications used with a non-reparenting
window manager (e.g. cwm).

2. Native Libraries
-------------------

Functionality depending on native libraries is not likely to work.
