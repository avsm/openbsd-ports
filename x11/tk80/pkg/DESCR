This package contains the binary release of Tk version 8.0, a GUI
toolkit for Tcl.

The best way to get started with Tcl is to read ``Tcl and the Tk
Toolkit'' by John K. Ousterhout, Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-63337-X.

A full set of manual pages is also provided with this package.

NOTE: This kit requires a Tcl8.0 binary kit.
