To finish the install, you need to enable the mod_jk
module using the following command as root:

      ${PREFIX}/sbin/mod_jk-enable

If you already have Apache running on your machine,
you should not use "apachectl restart" - instead,
you should fully stop and then start the server.

Please see ${DOCDIR}/README.OpenBSD
for more information.
