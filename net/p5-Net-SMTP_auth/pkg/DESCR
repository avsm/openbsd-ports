Net::SMTP_auth is a small extension to G. Barr's Net::SMTP
to authenticate to an SMTP server using one of the AUTH
methods provided by Authen::SASL (see RFC2554 for details).
This module can be expanded and is a very first implementation.

NOTE: Net::SMTP can do authentication by itself (with a
different Syntax).
