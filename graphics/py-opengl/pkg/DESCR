PyOpenGL is the cross platform Python binding to OpenGL and related
APIs.  The binding is created using the standard (in Python 2.5 and
above) ctypes library, and is provided under an extremely liberal
BSD-style Open-Source license.

PyOpenGL includes support for OpenGL v1.1 through 3.0, GLU, GLUT v3.7
(and FreeGLUT), and GLE 3.  It also includes support for hundreds of
OpenGL extensions.

PyOpenGL is interoperable with a large number of external GUI libraries
for Python including (wxPython, FxPy, PyGame, and Qt).  It can be used
with the Tkinter GUI library if you have installed the Togl widget for
Tk.
