Tntnet is a web application server for web applications written in C++.

You can write a Web-page with HTML and with special tags you embed
C++-code into the page for active contents. These pages, called
components, are compiled into C++-classes with the ecpp-compiler
"ecppc", then compiled into objectcode and linked into a shared library.
This shared library is loaded by the webserver "tntnet" on request and
executed.
