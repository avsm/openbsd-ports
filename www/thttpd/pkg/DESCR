httpd is a simple, small, fast, and secure HTTP server. It doesn't have a
lot of special features, but it suffices for most uses of the web, it's
about as fast as the best full-featured servers (Apache, NCSA, Netscape),
and it has one extremely useful feature (URL-traffic-based throttling)
that no other server currently has.
