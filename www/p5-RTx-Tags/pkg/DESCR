This module uses portions of HTML::TagCloud to provide a tag cloud
on Search/Simple.html.
The cloud consists of the values (split on commas, semi-colons
and whitespace) for all objects with the Tags custom field.

In addition to the cloud, this module provides support for
Simple Searchable Custom Fields witha Local overlay.
