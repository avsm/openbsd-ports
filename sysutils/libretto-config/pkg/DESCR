libretto-config - Libretto BIOS Setting Program

 The `libretto-config' is a utility program to configure the BIOS
setting of the mini notebook computer, Toshiba Libretto. Changes to
the setting are immediately done, so rebooting is not necessary.
  I don't know whether these programs work on any other machines but
Libretto. In case of Toshiba's notebook machines, some function may 
work.
