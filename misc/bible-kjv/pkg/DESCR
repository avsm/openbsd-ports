bible-kjv (formerly Bible Retrieval System) is a text-retrieval
program and user interface which is primarily designed to operate
on the included text and concordance of the King James translation
of the Bible, although it could, in principle, be used for any text.
The search/browse engine allows searching and reading passages from
scripture.  Includes full concordance.
