To activate the new printing system do the following:

- save your old printcap (`cp /etc/printcap /etc/printcap.save')
- set `lpd_enable=NO' in /etc/rc.conf
- reboot or kill the old lpd (`killall lpd') and
  start the new one (`/usr/local/libexec/lpd')
- remember to adjust your aliases or your PATH to use the new programs

Note that LPRng searches /usr/local/etc before /etc for
its configuration files.

For further information, have a look at:
