  About Wingz
  -----------

  Wingz is an easy-to-use, graphical spreadsheet for business and technical
  professionals, that allows users to create sophisticated presentations
  and reports, as well as user interfaces and end-user applications.

  The product is available today on UNIX(R) operating systems under
  OSF/Motif(TM) and OPEN LOOK(R) graphical interfaces, in addition to
  Microsoft Windows(TM), Apple(R) Macintosh(R), OS/2(R) Presentation
  Manager(TM), and NeXTstep(R).

  Wingz was originally developed by Informix(R) but effective from
  January 30th, 1995 Informix granted exclusive distribution rights to IISC.

This port uses the linux-compat system, but hopefully that'll be
invisible to the end user.
