arp-scan is a command-line tool for system discovery and fingerprinting.
It constructs and sends ARP requests to the specified IP addresses,
and displays any responses that are received.

arp-scan allows you to:

    * Send ARP packets to any number of destination hosts, using a
    configurable output bandwidth or packet rate.

          This is useful for system discovery, where you may need
          to scan large address spaces.

    * Construct the outgoing ARP packet in a flexible way.

          arp-scan gives control of all of the fields in the ARP
          packet and the fields in the Ethernet frame header.

    * Decode and display any returned packets.

          arp-scan will decode and display any received ARP packets
          and lookup the vendor using the MAC address.

    * Fingerprint IP hosts using the arp-fingerprint tool.
