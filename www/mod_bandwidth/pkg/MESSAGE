To finish the install of ${PKGNAME}, you need
to enable the module using the following command

  ${PREFIX}/sbin/mod_bandwidth-enable

If you already have Apache running on your machine,
you should not use "apachectl restart" - instead,
you should fully stop and then start the server.

Help is available in:
${PREFIX}/share/doc/mod_bandwidth/README.mod_bandwidth

For correct results, it is important that there aren't any "dead" links
in the "link" directory of mod_bandwidth when you start the server.
It may be a good idea to run the ${PREFIX}/sbin/cleanlink.pl daemon to
remove them automatically.
