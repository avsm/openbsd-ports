This dock-app kills (and restarts) netscape when you click
on the icon! You can now specify which program to kill and
if you want to restart it or not.

See wmNetscapeKiller --help for command line options.

It must be launched under the same username of the user of
WindowMaker.  If you dock it as root and you use Netscape as
user your preferences will not be reloaded.
