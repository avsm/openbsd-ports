Thunar vcs plugin adds Subversion actions to the context menu of thunar.
The current features are:
* Most of the svn action: add, checkout, cleanup, commit, copy, delete,
  export, import, lock, log, move, properties, resolved, revert, status,
  unlock, update.
* Subversion info in file properties dialog.
In the future, git will be supported too.
