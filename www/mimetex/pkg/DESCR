MimeTeX lets you easily embed LaTeX math in your html pages. It parses
a LaTeX math expression and immediately emits the corresponding gif
image, rather than the usual TeX dvi. And mimeTeX is an entirely
separate little program that doesn't use TeX or its fonts in any way.
It's just one cgi that will be installed in your site's cgi-bin/ directory,
with no other dependencies.
