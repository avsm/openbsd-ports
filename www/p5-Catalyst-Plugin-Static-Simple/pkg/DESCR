The Static::Simple plugin is designed to make serving static content
in your application during development quick and easy, without
requiring a single line of code from you.

It will detect static files used in your application by looking for file
extensions in the URI. By default, you can simply load this plugin and
it will immediately begin serving your static files with the correct
MIME type. The light-weight MIME::Types module is used to map file
extensions to IANA-registered MIME types.
