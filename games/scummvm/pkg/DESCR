ScummVM is a 'virtual machine' for several classic graphical point-and-click
adventure games. It is designed to run: Adventure Soft's Simon the
Sorcerer 1 and 2; Revolution's Beneath A Steel Sky, Broken Sword 1 and
Broken Sword 2; Flight of the Amazon Queen and games based on LucasArts'
SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion) system. SCUMM is used
for many games, including Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, Sam and Max
and more.

Note that you must possess the original games to play in most cases.
