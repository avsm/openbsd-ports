ZenIRC is a full-featured scriptable IRC client for the EMACS text
editor. Most features are implemented via module extensions. For
example, DCC (Direct Client-to-Client) can be enabled at the user's
option.

Note that this package also comes with "zenirc-chanbuf.el" which allows
to have one channel per IRC buffer. See [*] for details.
