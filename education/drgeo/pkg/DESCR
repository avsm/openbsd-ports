Dr. Geo is the GNOME interactive geometry software. It allows
the creation of geometric figures and their interactive manipulation
while respecting their geometric constraints. 

It was formerly called Dr Genius.
A similar program, kig is part of the kdeedu package.

The documentation is in a separate package, drgeo-doc, and it requires
an html viewer such as konqueror (kdebase) or dillo to be usable.
