perfd automatically adjusts the sysctl(3) hw.setperf value depending
on current processor usage. This allows laptop users to conserve
battery life whilst the machine is idling, but to have good
performance when performing CPU-intensive tasks. It also allows
desktop and server users to keep their machine running at low
temperatures when not performing CPU-intensive tasks.
