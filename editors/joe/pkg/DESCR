joe is the professional freeware ASCII text screen editor for UNIX.
It makes full use of the power and versatility of UNIX, but lacks the steep
learning curve and basic nonsense you have to deal with in every other UNIX
editor. joe has the feel of most IBM PC text editors: The key-sequences are
reminiscent of WordStar and Turbo-C. joe is much more powerful than those
editors, however. joe has all of the features a UNIX user should expect:
full use of termcap/terminfo, excellent screen update optimizations (joe is
fully useable at 2400 baud), simple installation, and all of the
UNIX-integration features of vi.
