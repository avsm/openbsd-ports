Active Merchant is an extraction from the e-commerce system Shopify.
Shopify's requirements for a simple and unified API to access dozens
of different payment gateways with very different internal APIs was
the chief principle in designing the library.

Active Merchant has been in production use since June 2006 and is
now used in most modern Ruby applications which deal with financial
transactions.
