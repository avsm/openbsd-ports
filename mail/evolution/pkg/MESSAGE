| Setuid note:
|
| If you intend to use Evolution to read local mail-spool mbox files then
| you will need to set the setuid bit for the camel-lock-helper program.
|
| You can do this by: 'chmod u+s ${PREFIX}/sbin/camel-lock-helper'
|
| While there are no known security problems at this time with
| camel-lock-helper, setting the setuid bit on any program is a
| potential security risk.
