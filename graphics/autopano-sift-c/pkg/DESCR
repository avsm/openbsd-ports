Autopano-SIFT-C automatically creates control points for
groups of overlapping photographs using SIFT ("scale-invariant
feature transform").

It can be controlled from within the Hugin GUI front-end.

N.B. The SIFT algorithm is restricted in the USA by a patent
owned by the University of British Columbia.
