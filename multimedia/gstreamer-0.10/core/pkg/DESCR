GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling
components. The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis
playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video
(non-linear editing) processing.

Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter
technology transparently. Developers can add new codecs and filters by
writing a simple plugin with a clean, generic interface.
