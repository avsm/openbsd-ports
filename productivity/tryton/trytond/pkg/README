| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that to produce graphs the py-dot package needs to be installed;
the dependency is not enforced because it requires graphviz which
depends on lots of graphical packages.

Before starting the trytond server, several steps are required.

Configuration
=============
Edit ${SYSCONFDIR}/trytond.conf based on your configuration and needs.
The "db_password" and "admin_passwd" MUST be changed.

PostgreSQL
==========
Assuming you have an administrative account named `postgres', you can
create the 'tryton' user like this:
    # createuser -U postgres --pwprompt --no-superuser --createdb \
        --no-createrole tryton

Make sure to set the 'tryton' DB user password to the value of
"db_password" in ${SYSCONFDIR}/trytond.conf.

First start
===========
Start the trytond server:
    # /etc/rc.d/trytond start

You can now launch the tryton client, then go under:
    File -> Database -> New Database
to initialise your new DB.

The /var/log/trytond file can grow very marge with time, it is advised
to use newsyslog(8) to rotate it.
