PLIB is a suite of portable game librairies.

PLIB includes sound effects, music, a complete 3D engine, font
rendering, a simple Windowing library, a game scripting language, a GUI,
networking, 3D math library and a collection of handy utility functions.
All are 100% portable across nearly all modern computing platforms.
Each library component is fairly independent of the others - so if you
want to use SDL, GTK, GLUT, or FLTK instead of PLIB's 'PW' windowing
library, you can.
