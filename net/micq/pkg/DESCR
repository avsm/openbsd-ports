mICQ is a very portable text-mode ICQ clone - it is known to compile
under Linux, BSD, AIX, HPUX, Windows, AmigaOS and with restrictions
BeOS. Originally written by Matthew D. Smith, a great part of mICQ has
been rewritten by Rüdiger Kuhlmann, in particular the support for the
new version 8 of the ICQ protocol that became necessary, the
internationalization, the file transfer and some restructuring of the
code.
