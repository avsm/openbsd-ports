+---------------
| To finish the install of mod_auth_ldap, you need
| to enable the module using the following command
|
|   ${PREFIX}/sbin/mod_auth_ldap-enable
|
| If you already have Apache running on your machine,
| you should not use "apachectl restart" - instead,
| you should fully stop and then restart the server.
