Heimdal is a free implementation of Kerberos 5. The goals are to:

- have an implementation that can be freely used by anyone
- be protocol compatible with existing implementations and,
  if not in conflict, with RFC 1510 (and any future updated RFC)
- be reasonably compatible with the M.I.T Kerberos V5 API
- have support for Kerberos V5 over GSS-API (RFC1964)
- include the most important and useful application programs
  (rsh, telnet, popper, etc.)
- include enough backwards compatibility with Kerberos V4
