Asymptote is a powerful descriptive vector graphics language that
provides a natural coordinate-based framework for technical drawing.
Labels and equations are typeset with LaTeX, for high-quality PostScript
output.

A major advantage of Asymptote over other graphics packages is that it
is a programming language, as opposed to just a graphics program.
