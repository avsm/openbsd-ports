Chive is a next generation MySQL database management tool. The
web-based user interface supports most of the common operations
needed by software developers and database admins (databases,
tables, indices, keys, triggers, views, routines, privilege
management, import/export).

Chive aims to be an alternative to phpMyAdmin.
