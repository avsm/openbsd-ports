KAFFE v0.8.4 - A JIT and interpreting virtual machine to run Java(tm)* code
===========================================================================

This is Kaffe, a virtual machine design to execute Java bytecode.
This machine can be configured in two modes.  In one mode it operates as
a pure bytecode interpreter (not unlike Javasoft's machine); in the second
mode if performs "just-in-time" code conversion from the abstract code to
the host machine's native code.  This will ultimately allow execution of
Java code at the same speed as standard compiled code but while maintaining
the advantages and flexibility of code independence.

Who can use Kaffe
=================

This version of Kaffe is distributed under a Berkeley style license.
Essentially you can use Kaffe for both personal and commerical purpose, on
its own or as part of another package (see license.terms for full details).

Kaffe Web and FTP sites
=======================

Kaffe is available from various sites.  The primary site is:

        ftp://ftp.kaffe.org/pub/kaffe/

Kaffe mailing lists
===================

A couple of mailing lists are available for information and discussion of
the Kaffe project.  There lists are:
  
        kaffe@kaffe.org                         - General discussions
        kaffe-announce@kaffe.org                - Announcements
  
To subscribe to these lists send a message containing the word "subscribe"
to either:
        
        kaffe-request@kaffe.org
        kaffe-announce-request@kaffe.org
  
depending what you are interested in.

If you want to report bugs directly to me, you can now use the script

	report-kaffe-bug

This should be automatically installed during the standard installation
procedure.  The system is based on GNU's GNATS but has been specifically
tailored for Kaffe's purposes.  Just invoke the command from your shell
and it'll ask for all the necessary details.

The state of play
=================

Kaffe should run all Java code.  However there are still bugs and plenty
of untested native library functions.  Some functions which are not
currently implemented (most often because I don't understand exactly what
they are suppose to do) will simply abort if called.  If you can help
out on any of these then please do *BUT* remember, this is a clean-room
implementation (I have never seen any of Sun's Java source code) and
I cannot simply encorporate Javasoft's* code.

Kaffe and Sun's Java
====================

Kaffe is a clean-room implementation of a virtual machine which can run
Java bytecode.  It is capable of interpreting code generated by Sun's
software but has not been derived from any Sun code.  Currently this version
utilises Sun's freely available compiled class library but it is hoped
that this will be replaced with a freely available version in due time.
At the moment it is impossible to validate whether this software is
Java compatible(tm) (the test suites are not publically available) and
the terms under which this can be claimed are unknown.

Erm, that's it ....
