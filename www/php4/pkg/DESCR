At the most basic level, PHP can do anything any other CGI program 
can do, such as collect form data, generate dynamic page content, 
or send and receive cookies.

PHP also has support for talking to other services using protocols
such as IMAP, SNMP, NNTP, POP3, or even HTTP. You can also open 
raw network sockets and interact using other protocols.

PHP has a number of extra flavors available:

 - curl     Client URL library functions (gopher, dict, ldap, etc)
 - gettext  GNU gettext support for internationalisation
 - imap     Mail and message access functions (IMAP, POP3, NTTP)
 - ldap     Access to LDAP-compliant Directory Services
 - mhash    Hashing functions such as MD5, SHA1, etc
 - mcrypt   Interface to block and stream encryption algorithms
 - mm       Shared memory support for session storage
 - recode   GNU Recode support for character set conversion
 - snmp     Simple Network Management Protocol access functions
 - gd       Generate PNG or JPEG images on the fly
 - pdflib   Generate Adobe PDF documents dynamically

In addition, the following database flavors are supported:

   gdbm, dbase, filepro, mysql, postgresql, and iodbc

If you wish to compile PHP without X, use the no_x11 flavor.
