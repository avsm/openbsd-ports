 .BR jk_init

+.I ${SYSCONFDIR}/jailkit/jk_init.ini
 predefined that work on Debian or Ubuntu systems. For other platforms you might need to update the predefined configuration. For example, you can use jk_init to quickly set up a limited shell, a jail to run apache, or a jail for just sftp and scp. It will copy the binaries, the required libraries (and related symlinks) as well as other files such as /etc/passwd. These are all copied into the jail directory so that a jailed process can run them.

 It is typically started in one of two ways, by specifying it as the user's shell or by using the jk_chrootsh program. The first way is implemented by specifying jk_lsh as the shell in the user's entry in the 'real'
 .I /etc/passwd
 file. In this case, it executes in the normal file system and reads its configuration from 
-.I /etc/jailkit/jk_lsh.ini.
+.I ${SYSCONFDIR}/jailkit/jk_lsh.ini.
 In the second way, jk_lsh is started from within jk_chrootsh by specifying it as the shell in the passwd file located inside the JAIL directory:
 .I JAIL/etc/passwd,
 in which case it reads its configuration from within the JAIL:
-.I JAIL/etc/jailkit/jk_lsh.ini.
+.I JAIL${SYSCONFDIR}/jailkit/jk_lsh.ini.
 The latter is the recommended approach for highest security.
 Use this program if you want to deny regular shell access (e.g. logins) but you want to allow execution of only one or a few commands such sftp, scp, rsync, or cvs.
