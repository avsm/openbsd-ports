| In order to use fvwm2 as your window manager, you must change your
| .xinitrc or .xsession appropriately and add a line similiar to the
| following:
|
| 	exec ${PREFIX}/bin/fvwm2
|
| Icons have been installed into ${PREFIX}/fvicons, and a system wide 
| configuration has been put in ${PREFIX}/share/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc. To 
| use your own configuration, copy ${PREFIX}/share/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc to
| ~/.fvwm2rc and edit it as appropriate.
