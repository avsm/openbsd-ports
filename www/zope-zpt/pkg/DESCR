Page Templates are a web page generation tool. They help programmers
and designers collaborate in producing dynamic web pages for Zope
web applications. Designers can use them to maintain pages without
having to abandon their tools, while preserving the work required
to embed those pages in an application.

The goal of Page Templates is natural workflow. A designer will use
a WYSIWYG HTML editor to create a template, then a programmer will
edit it to make it part of an application. If required, the designer
can load the template back into his editor and make further changes
to its structure and appearance. By taking reasonable steps to
preserve the changes made by the programmer, he will not disrupt
the application.
