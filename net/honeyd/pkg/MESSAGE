Configuring honeyd for use on OpenBSD
-------------------------------------

Honeyd requires an arp daemon to (falsely) answer arp queries. rarpd(8)
in base or arpd from ports can both be used for this. See honeyd(8) for
more detailed information on setting up honeyd.

To launch honeyd as a daemon, you can use the following command:
honeyd -u 546 -g 546 -f ${SYSCONFDIR}/honeyd.conf
