Databases
=========
Django supports number of different databases, but you need
to install Python database adapter(s) to use them:
* py-mysql - for MySQL database, 
* py-psycopg2 - for PostgreSQL database.

SQLite works out-of-the-box.

UTF-8
=====
Django assumes that you're running UTF-8 capable system, but
it doesn't enforce any locales, which results in regressions
when running in an environment without enabled UTF-8 locale.

This means that, unless you've got UTF-8 locale enabled for
your profile, you need to enable UTF-8 while starting Django
process:

    $ env LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 ./manage.py runserver

or configure your application server to pass this setting.
