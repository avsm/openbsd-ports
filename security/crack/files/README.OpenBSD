To use Crack 5.0 on OpenBSD:

   $ cd %%TRUEPREFIX%%/crack
   $ sudo ./Crack -fmt openbsd /etc/master.passwd

This will start a background process trying to crack all the passwords
in your master password file.

Run

   $ ./Reporter

to see how Crack is getting on.

Entries such as

   E:0:ignoring locked entry: _fingerd

are to be expected; these accounts do not have passwords set, but
are locked so that no login is possible.
