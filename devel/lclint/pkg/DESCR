LCLint is a tool for statically checking C programs.  With minimal
effort, LCLint can be used as a better lint.  If additional effort is
invested adding annotations to programs, LCLint can perform stronger
checks than can be done by any standard lint.

LCLint can detect lots of obscure errors that other lints can't find.
It takes some getting used to, and tends to output quite a large number
of warnings unless tuned for the current project.
