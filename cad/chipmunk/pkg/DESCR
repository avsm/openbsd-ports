The software tools in the Chipmunk system perform a wide variety of
tasks: electronic circuit simulation and schematic capture, graphics
editing, and curve plotting, to name a few.

Here is a brief description of each of the Chipmunk tools:

  Log: a graphical environment for entering circuit schematics, and
       for analog and digital circuit simulation.

  View: a tool for manipulating and plotting data.

  Until: a graphics editor.

  Wol: a tool for creating integrated circuit layout.

In addition to these major tools, many supplementary tools are part of
the Chipmunk system.

These tools were originally written for HP 200 Series ("Chipmunk")
computers, and were later ported to Unix and the X Window System.
