Gtkpool is a simple pool simulation game with neat gtk
interface. It currently supports 8 and 9-ball pool,
has cool settings like friction and collision drag.

The game has some minor problems and is going to improve,
with even more customizable features, adding network
support, making the engine more realistic.
