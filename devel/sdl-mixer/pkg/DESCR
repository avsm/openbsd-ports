SDL_mixer is a sample multi-channel audio mixer library.  It supports
any number of simultaneously playing channels of 16 bit stereo audio,
plus a single channel of music, mixed by the popular MikMod MOD, Ogg
Vorbis, Timidity MIDI, and SMPEG MP3 libraries.

NOTE:  On big endian systems, SDL_mixer appears to output mp3 and
       libmikmod files in the wrong byte order which results in scratchy
       noise.
