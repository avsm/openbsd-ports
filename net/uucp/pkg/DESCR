This is the standard UUCP package of the Free Software Foundation.

The package currently supports the 'f', 'g' (in all window and packet
sizes), 'G', 't' and 'e' protocols, as well a Zmodem protocol, the FX
UUCICO 'y' protocol, and two new bidirectional protocols.  If you have
a Berkeley sockets library, it can make TCP connections.  If you have
TLI libraries, it can make TLI connections.  It supports a new
configuration file mechanism which I like (but other people dislike).
