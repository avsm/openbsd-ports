The X Printing Panel (XPP) is a fast, light, and completely free graphical
replacement for the command line printing commands for easy choosing of the
desired printer out of a list of all available printers and for setting printer
options by an easy-to-use graphical user interface. One simply calls the
program (xpp) instead of the usual utilities (lpr or lp) at the command line or
out of applications.
