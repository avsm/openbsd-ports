This library is for working with ".tar" archive files. It can read
and write a range of common variations of archive format including
V7, USTAR, POSIX and GNU formats. It provides support for packing
and unpacking portable archives. This makes it suitable for
distribution but not backup because details like file ownership and
exact permissions are not preserved.
