The Cyrus IMAP server differs from other IMAP server implementations in
that it is generally intended to be run on sealed servers, where normal
users are not permitted to log in. The mailbox database is stored in
parts of the filesystem that are private to the Cyrus IMAP system. All
user access to mail is through the IMAP, POP3, or KPOP protocols.

The private mailbox database design gives the server large advantages in
efficiency, scalability, and administratability. Multiple concurrent
read/write connections to the same mailbox are permitted. The server
supports access control lists on mailboxes and storage quotas on mailbox
hierarchies.

Because of cyrus-imapd+OpenBSD mmap uncompatibility, the server runs in
compat mode incuring a performance penalty under high load.

Following man pages have been renamed to avoid conflicts with other
packages:
    fetchnews(8) -> cyrus-fetchnews(8) # conflict with news/leafnode
    idled(8)     -> cyrus-idled(8)     # conflict with sysutils/idled
    master(8)    -> cyrus-master(8)    # conflict with mail/postfix
    imapd(8)     -> cyrus-imapd(8)     # conflict with mail/courier-imap

Cyrus-imapd uses the LOG_LOCAL6 syslog facility for logging. This port
of cyrus-imapd uses idled for IMAP IDLE.

Available flavor:
    drac     - Build drac support (for roaming users relay)
