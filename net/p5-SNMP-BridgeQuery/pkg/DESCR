BridgeQuery polls a device which responds to SNMP Bridge Table queries and
generates a hash reference with each polled MAC address as the key and the
associated port as the value. The specific MIBs that are polled are described
in RFC1493. On layer 3 switches, one can additionally poll IP addresses.
