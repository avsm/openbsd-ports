Before you can use ap2-mod_fcgid, you need to enable it on your
Apache2 configuration.

Edit ${SYSCONFDIR}/apache2/httpd2.conf and add the following line:

	LoadModule perl_module ${PREFIX}/lib/apache2/mod_fcgid.so

An example of mod_fcgid's use:
	<Location /fcgid>
	  SetHandler fcgid-script
	  Options ExecCGI
	  Allow from all
	</Location>
Where /var/apache2/htdocs/fcgid/ contains fastcgi scripts.

Restart your httpd2 for changes to make effect.
