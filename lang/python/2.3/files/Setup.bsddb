# Sleepycat Berkeley DB interface.

# This requires the Sleepycat DB code, see http://www.sleepycat.com/
# The earliest supported version of that library is 3.0, the latest
# supported version is 4.0 (4.1 is specifically not supported, as that
# changes the semantics of transactional databases). A list of available
# releases can be found at
#
# http://www.sleepycat.com/update/index.html
#
# Edit the variables DB and DBLIBVERto point to the db top directory
# and the subdirectory of PORT where you built it.
