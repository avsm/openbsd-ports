Ledger is an accounting tool with the moxie to exist. It provides no
bells or whistles, and returns the user to the days before user
interfaces were even a twinkling in their father's CRT. What it does
offer is a double-entry accounting ledger with all the flexibility and
muscle of its modern day cousins, without any of the fat. Think of it as
the Bran Muffin of accounting tools.
