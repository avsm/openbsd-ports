The PyOpenBSD library allows Python programs to interact with the
OpenBSD operating system in a smooth and seamless way. It consists of a
set of bindings for various system libraries, as well as interfaces for
inspecting in-kernel variables using kvm.

PyOpenBSD also contains some useful functionality not directly or solely
related to OpenBSD. At this stage there are no concrete plans to "spin
off" architecture-independent projects.
