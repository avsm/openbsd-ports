Future Technologies High Performance Liquid KDE style engine

Features:

* Translucent Menus. 

* Colors are fully configurable. This is really cool with this style. It
* also handles custom colors like KCalc's correctly. Check out the
screenshots below. 

* High performance. No scaling is required, and caching (thus memory usage)
* is kept to a minimum. I wanted to create a style engine that
both looked cool and is usable on an everyday basis by people doing stuff
like compiling all day. 

* Mouse Hover is supported for Pushbuttons, ComboBoxes, RadioButtons,
* CheckBoxes, and ScrollBars. This doesn't use the crappy
"draw a box around the widget" mouse hover, either, but makes the widget
appear to light up. 

* Automagically themes the KDE panel, according to the color scheme.
