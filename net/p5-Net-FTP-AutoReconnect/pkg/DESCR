Net::FTP::AutoReconnect is a wrapper module around Net::FTP.  For many
commands, if anything goes wrong on the first try, it tries to
disconnect and reconnect to the server, restore the state to the same as
it was when the command was executed, then execute it again.  The state
includes login credentials, authorize credentials, trans- fer mode
(ASCII or binary), current working directory, and any restart, passive,
or port commands sent.
