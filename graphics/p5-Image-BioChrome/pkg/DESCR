This module is designed to recolor images files. I built it because I am
regularly producing web sites with many common interface graphics where
we just need to change the colors. The name BioChrome comes from the
name of the special color changing cells that give a Chameleon its color
changing ability.

Also included in the distribution are modules that allow Apache (with
mod_perl) to build images on the fly and a Template::Toolkit plugin to
allow the creation of images from within a Template.
