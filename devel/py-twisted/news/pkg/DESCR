Twisted News provides a very basic NNTP server, as well as an NNTP
client protocol implementation. Two messages storage systems are
supported: the DB-API 2.0 backend stores and indexes messages in any
compatible SQL database; the Twisted dirdbm backend uses serialized
Python objects stored directly on the filesystem for message storage. 
Twisted News also has very rudamentary support for moderated groups.
