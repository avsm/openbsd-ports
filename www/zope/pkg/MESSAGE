+---------------
| This package uses the INSTANCE_HOME installation method, as described
| at http://www.zope.org/Members/4am/instancehome.  This allows you
| to install the Zope package once and create as many sites as you
| want without changing your core Zope installation.
|
| To create a Zope site, create a user and group to own it, create a
| directory for the site, and run
|
|	${PREFIX}/bin/zope-instance /path/to/site
|
| as the user who will own the site.
