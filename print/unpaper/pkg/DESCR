unpaper is a post-processing tool for scanned sheets of paper,
especially for book pages that have been scanned from previously created
photocopies.
The main purpose is to make scanned book pages better readable on screen
after conversion to PDF. Additionally, unpaper might be useful to
enhance the quality of scanned pages before performing optical character
recognition (OCR).
