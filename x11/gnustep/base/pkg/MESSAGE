To be able to use gdomap(8), add the following lines to services(5):
 gdomap 538/tcp # GNUstep distrib objects
 gdomap 538/udp # GNUstep distrib objects

Then see rc(8) to have "${PREFIX}/bin/gdomap -p" launched at boot time.

To be able to fully use the GNUstep framework, you should also add the
following lines to your ~/.xsession or ~/.xinitrc:
 . ${PREFIX}/share/GNUstep/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
 ${PREFIX}/bin/gdnc
