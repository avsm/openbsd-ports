READ THIS MESSAGE CAREFULLY, IT CONTAINS IMPORTANT SECURITY INFORMATION

Mantis has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
  # ln -s ../mantis /var/www/htdocs/mantis
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

You can ensure you have a working install by accessing:
http://localhost/mantis

Some important notes:

MySQL Database:

Install the database such that the Unix socket is in
/var/www/var/run/mysql/

Configuring:

Configure most of Mantis over the browser.  You will then need to edit the file
${INSTDIR}/mantis/config_defaults_inc.php.  Consult the
${INSTDIR}/mantis/doc/README file for more information.

Protecting the admin directory:

Make sure that you properly protect the /mantis/admin location to prevent
accessing it by unauthorized persons.  The following fragment for
/var/www/conf/httpd.conf limits access to clients connecting from localhost.
You might want to even password protect this location.

<Location "/mantis/admin">
        <Limit GET>
                Order allow,deny
                Allow from localhost
        </Limit>
</Location>

Changing the administrator password

Once you have configured you Mantis installation, login as the administrator
user with the default password 'root' and change it before you make yourxi
installation available.
