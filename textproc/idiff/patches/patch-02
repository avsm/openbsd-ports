+.TH IDIFF Local
+.SH NAME
+idiff \- interactive diff of two files
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B idiff
+file1 file2
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.I Idiff
+runs
+.IR diff (1)
+on the specified files and then
+presents each chunk of
+.I diff
+output and offers the user the option of
+choosing the ``from'' part or the ``to'' part,
+or editing the parts.
+.I Idiff
+produces the selected pieces in the proper order in a file called
+.IR idiff.out .
+.LP
+After each chunk is presented,
+.I idiff
+will prompt the user (with a `? ')
+for a command.
+The valid commands are:
+.TP
+.B <
+Take the ``from'' portion of the displayed chunk.
+This is the portion which
+was extracted from the first file specified.
+.TP
+.B >
+Take the ``to'' portion of the displayed chunk.
+This corresponds to that
+extracted from the second file specified.
+.TP
+.B e
+Invoke an editor on the chunk.
+The contents of shell variable EDITOR select the editor to be used.
+The default is
+.IR /bin/ed .
+Whatever is written out from
+.I ed
+will be placed into the final output.
+.TP
+.B q<
+Take all the rest of the '<' choices automatically.
+Think of this as ``quit from''.
+.TP
+.B q>
+Take all the rest of the '>' choices automatically.
+Think of this as ``quit to''.
+.TP
+.B !
+Pass the command buffer to the shell for processing.
+.LP
+All code that
+.I diff
+considers identical in both input files 
+is automatically put into the output file.
+.SH FILES
+.I idiff.out 
+\- merged output
+.SH BUGS
+It is not possible to pass any options to
+.I diff
+through
+.I idiff.
+Giving a file and a directory for
+.I diff
+to search for the second file will fail in strange ways.
+.SH HISTORY
+.I Idiff
+appears in the book
+.I ``The UNIX Programming Environment''
+by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike.
