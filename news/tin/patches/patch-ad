 .SH DESCRIPTION
 .B tin

-\fI/var/spool/news\fP) or remotely (\fBrtin\fR or \fBtin -r\fR option) via a
+\fI/var/news\fP) or remotely (\fBrtin\fR or \fBtin -r\fR option) via a

 At startup, \fBtin\fR reads in the configuration file. This contains a list
 of variables that can be used to configure the way \fBtin\fR works. If it
-exists, the global configuration file, \fI/usr/lib/news/tinrc\fP is read.
+exists, the global configuration file, \fI/usr/local/lib/news/tinrc\fP is read.
 After that, the users own configuration file is read from

 system-wide defaults to new users who have no private tinrc yet.
