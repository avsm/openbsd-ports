Simplified sample configuration is provided in ${SYSCONFDIR}/asterisk;
the full set is available in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/asterisk/default.

To have Asterisk start at boot time, you may insert the following
into /etc/rc.local:

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/safe_asterisk ]; then
        echo -n ' asterisk';   ${PREFIX}/sbin/safe_asterisk
fi
