DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader automates the definition of a
DBIx::Class::Schema by scanning table schemas and setting up columns and
primary keys.

DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader currently supports only the DBI storage
type. It has explicit support for DBD::Pg, DBD::mysql, DBD::DB2, and
DBD::SQLite. Other DBI drivers may function.
