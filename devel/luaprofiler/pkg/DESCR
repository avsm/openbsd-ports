LuaProfiler is a time profiler designed to help finding bottlenecks on
your Lua program.

If you use LuaProfiler into your program, it will generate a log of all
your function calls and their respective running times. You can use this
log to generate a summary of the functions your program uses, along with
how long it stayed in each of them, or you can import the log into a
spreadsheet for further analysis.
