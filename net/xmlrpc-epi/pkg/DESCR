xmlrpc-epi is an implementation of the xmlrpc protocol
in C. It provides an easy to use API for developers to
serialize RPC requests to and from XML. It does *not*
include a transport layer, such as HTTP. The API is
primarily based upon proprietary code written for
internal usage at Epinions.com, and was later modified
to incorporate concepts from the xmlrpc protocol. It
passed the xmlrpc validation test suite in December 2000.
