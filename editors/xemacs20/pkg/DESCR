About XEmacs:

XEmacs (formerly known as Lucid Emacs) is a powerful, extensible text
editor with full GUI support, initially based on an early version of
GNU Emacs 19 from the Free Software Foundation and since kept up to
date with recent versions of that product.  XEmacs stems from a
collaboration of Lucid, Inc. with Sun Microsystems, Inc. and the
University of Illinois with additional support having been provided by
Amdahl Corporation, INS Engineering Corporation, and a huge amount of
volunteer effort.

XEmacs provides a great number of new features.  More details on
XEmacs's functionality, including bundled packages, can be obtained
through the info on-line information system.

The XEmacs web page can be browsed, using any WWW browser at

		    http://www.xemacs.org/

Note that W3 (XEmacs's own browser), might need customization (due to
firewalls) in order to work correctly.

XEmacs is the result of the time and effort of many people.  The
developers responsible for the 20.3 release are:

	* SL Baur  <steve@xemacs.org>
	* Jason Mastaler  <jason@mastaler.com>
	* Martin Buchholz  <mrb@sun.eng.com>
	* Kyle Jones  <kyle_jones@wonderworks.com>
	* Hrvoje Niksic  <hniksic@srce.hr>

	* And many other contributors...

crucial to each of these releases.
