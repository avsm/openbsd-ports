libguess employs discrete-finite automata to deduce the character set of
the input buffer. The advantage of this is that all character sets can
be checked in parallel, and quickly. Right now, libguess passes a byte
to each DFA on the same pass, meaning that the winning character set can
be deduced as efficiently as possible.
